<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_REVISED_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_REVISED_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION</h2>


<p>Since 1888, when this Life was originally
published, the history of American Politics has
been greatly enriched. The painstaking and candid
labors of Mr. Fiske, Mr. Adams, Mr. Rhodes,
and others have gone far to render unnecessary the
<i>caveat</i> I then entered against the unfairness, or at
least the narrowness, of the temper with which Van
Buren, or the school to which he belonged, had thus
far been treated in American literature, and which
had prejudicially misled me before I began my
work. Such a <i>caveat</i> is no longer necessary.
Even now, when the political creed of which Jefferson,
Van Buren, and Tilden have been chief
apostles in our land, seems to suffer some degree
of eclipse,&mdash;only temporary, it may well be believed,
but nevertheless real,&mdash;those who, like
myself, have undertaken to present the careers of
great Americans who held this faith need not fear
injustice or prejudice in the field of American literature.</p>

<p>In this revised edition I have made a few corrections
and added a few notes; but the generous
treatment which has been given to the book has
confirmed my belief that historic truth requires no
material change.</p>

<p>A passage from the diary of Charles Jared
Ingersoll (Life by William M. Meigs, 1897)
tempts me, in this most conspicuous place of the
book, to emphasize my observation upon one injustice
often done to Van Buren. Referring, on May
6, 1844, to his letter, then just published, against
the annexation of Texas, Mr. Ingersoll declared
that, in view of the fact that nearly all of Van
Buren's admirers and most of the Democratic press
were committed to the annexation, Van Buren had
committed a great blunder and become <i>felo de se</i>.
The assumption here is that Van Buren was a politician
of the type so painfully familiar to us, whose
sole and conscienceless effort is to find out what is
to be popular for the time, in order, for their own
profit, to take that side. That Van Buren was
politic there can be no doubt. But he was politic
after the fashion of a statesman and not of a demagogue.
He disliked to commit himself upon issues
which had not been fully discussed, which were not
ripe for practical solution by popular vote, and
which did not yet need to be decided. Mr. Ingersoll
should have known that the direct and simple
explanation was the true one,&mdash;that Van Buren
knew the risk and meant to take it. His letter
against the annexation of Texas, written when he
knew that it would probably defeat him for the
presidency, was but one of several acts performed
by him at critical periods, wherein he deliberately
took what seemed the unpopular side in order to
be true to his sense of political and patriotic duty.
The crucial tests of this kind through which he
successfully passed must, beyond any doubt, put
him in the very first rank of those American
statesmen who have had the rare union of political
foresight and moral courage.</p>

<span class="ft80">AMERICAN POLITICS WHEN VAN BUREN'S CAREER
BEGAN.&mdash;JEFFERSON'S INFLUENCE</span></h2>


<p>It sometimes happened during the anxious years
when the terrors of civil war, though still smouldering,
were nearly aflame, that on Wall Street or
Nassau Street, busy men of New York saw Martin
Van Buren and his son walking arm in arm.
"Prince John," tall, striking in appearance, his
hair divided at the middle in a fashion then novel
for Americans, was in the prime of life, resolute
and aggressive in bearing. His father was a white-haired,
bright-eyed old man, erect but short in
figure, of precise though easy and kindly politeness,
and with a touch of deference in his manner.
His presence did not peremptorily command the
attention of strangers; but to those who looked attentively
there was plain distinction in the refined
and venerable face. Passers-by might well turn
back to see more of the two men thus affectionately
and picturesquely together. For they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
famous characters,&mdash;the one in the newer, the
other in the older politics of America. John Van
Buren, fresh from his Free Soil battle and the tussles
of the Hards and Softs, was striving, as a
Democrat, to serve the cause of the Union, though
conscious that he rested under the suspicion of the
party to whose service, its divisions in New York
now seemingly ended, he had reluctantly returned.
But he still faced the slave power with an independence
only partially abated before the exigencies
of party loyalty. The ex-President, definitely
withdrawn from the same Free Soil battle,
a struggle into which he had entered when the
years were already heavy upon him, had survived
to be once more a worthy in the Democratic party,
again to receive its formal veneration, but never
again its old affection. In their timid man&#339;uvres
with slavery it was perhaps with the least possible
awkwardness that the northern Democrats sought
to treat him as a great Democratic leader; but
they did not let it be forgotten that the leader
was forever retired from leadership. While the
younger man was in the thick of political encounters
which the party carried on in blind futility,
the older man was hardly more than an historical
personage. He was no longer, his friends strove
to think, the schismatic candidate of 1848, but
rather the ally and friend of Jackson, or, better
still and further away, the disciple of Jefferson.</p>

<p>For, more than any other American, Martin Van
Buren had succeeded to the preaching of Jeffer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>son's
political doctrines, and to his political power
as well, that curious and potent mingling of philosophy,
statesmanship, and electioneering. The
Whigs' distrust towards Van Buren was still bitter;
the hot anger of his own party over the blow
he had dealt in 1848 was still far from subsided;
the gratitude of most Free Soil men had completely
disappeared with his apparent acquiescence in the
politics of Pierce and Buchanan. Save in a narrow
circle of anti-slavery Democrats, Van Buren,
in these last days of his, was judged at best with
coldness, and most commonly with dislike or even
contempt. Not much of any other temper has yet
gone into political history; its writers have frequently
been content to accept the harshness of
partisan opinion, or even the scurrility and mendacity
visited upon him during his many political
campaigns, and to ignore the positive records of his
career and public service. The present writer confesses
to have begun this Life, not indeed sharing
any of the hatred or contempt so commonly felt
towards Van Buren, but still given to many serious
depreciations of him, which a better examination
has shown to have had their ultimate source in the
mere dislike of personal or political enemies,&mdash;a
dislike to whose expression, often powerful and
vivid, many writers have extended a welcome seriously
inconsistent with the fairness of history.</p>

<p>When Abraham Lincoln was chosen president
in 1860, this predecessor of his by a quarter century
was a true historical figure. The bright,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
genial old man connected, visibly and really, those
stirring and dangerous modern days with the first
political struggles under the American Constitution,
struggles then long passed into the quiet of
history, to leave him almost their only living reminiscence.
Martin Van Buren was a man fully
grown and already a politician when in 1801 the
triumph of Thomas Jefferson completed the political
foundation of the United States. Its profound
inspiration still remained with him on this eve of
Lincoln's election. Under its influence his political
career had begun and had ended.</p>

<p>At Jefferson's election the aspiration and fervor
which attended the first, the new-born sense of
American national life, had largely worn away.
The ideal visions of human liberty had long before
grown dim during seven years of revolutionary
war, with its practical hardships, its vicissitudes of
meanness and glory, and during the four years of
languor and political incompetence which followed.
In the agitation for better union, political theories
filled the minds of our forefathers. Lessons were
learned from the Ach&aelig;an League, as well as from
the Swiss Confederation, the German Empire, and
the British Constitution. Both history and speculation,
however, were firmly subordinated to an
extraordinary common sense, in part flowing from,
as it was most finely exhibited in, the luminous and
powerful, if unexalted, genius of Franklin. From
the open beginning of constitution-making at Annapolis
in 1786 until the inauguration of John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Adams, the American people, under the masterful
governing of Washington, were concerned with the
framework upon which the fabric of their political
life was to be wrought. The framework was doubtless
in itself of a vast and enduring importance.
If the consolidating and aristocratic schemes of
Hamilton had not met defeat in the federal convention,
or if the separatist jealousies of Patrick
Henry and George Clinton had not met defeat in
Virginia and New York after the work of the convention
was done, there would to-day be a different
American people. Nor would our history be the
amazing story of the hundred years past. But
upon the governmental framework thus set up
could be woven political fabrics widely and essentially
different in their material, their use, and
their enduring virtue. For quite apart from the
framework of government were the temper and traditions
of popular politics out of which comes, and
must always come, the essential and dominant nature
of public institutions. In this creative and
deeper work Jefferson was engaged during his
struggle for political power after returning from
France in 1789, during his presidential career
from 1801 to 1809, and during the more extraordinary,
and in American history the unparalleled,
supremacy of his political genius after he had left
office. In the circumstances of our colonial life,
in our race extractions, in our race fusion upon the
Atlantic seaboard, and in the moral effect of forcible
and embittered separation from the parent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
country, arose indeed, to go no further back, the
political instincts of American men. It is, however,
fatal to adequate conception of our political
development to ignore the enormous formative influence
which the twenty years of Jefferson's rule
had upon American political character. But so
partial and sometimes so partisan have been the
historians of our early national politics in their
treatment of that great man, that a just appreciation
of the political atmosphere in which Van
Buren began his career is exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p>There was an American government, an American
nation, when Washington gladly escaped to
Mt. Vernon from the bitterly factional quarrels of
the politicians at Philadelphia. The government
was well ordered; the nation was respectable and
dignified. But most of the people were either still
colonial and provincial, or were rushing, in turbulence
and bad temper, to crude speculations and
theories. Twenty-five years later, Jefferson had
become the political idol of the American people,
a people completely and forever saturated with
democratic aspirations, democratic ideals, what
John Marshall called "political metaphysics," a
people with strong and lasting characteristics, no
longer either colonial or provincial, but profoundly
national. The skill, the industry, the arts of the
politician, had been used by a man gifted with
the genius and not free from the faults of a philosopher,
to plant in American usages, prejudices,
and traditions,&mdash;in the very fibre of American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
political life, a cardinal and fruitful idea. The
work was done for all time. For Americans, government
was thenceforth to be a mere instrument.
No longer a symbol, or an ornament or crown of
national life, however noble and august, it was a
simple means to a plain end; to be always, and if
need be rudely, tested and measured by its practical
working, by its service to popular rights and
needs. In those earlier days, too, there had been
"classes and masses," the former of whom held
public service and public policy as matters of dignity
and order and high assertion of national right
and power, requiring in their ministers peculiar
and esoteric light, and an equipment of which
common men ought not to judge, because they
could not judge aright. Afterward, in Monroe's
era of good feeling, the personal rivalries of presidential
candidates were in bad temper enough; but
Americans were at last all democrats. Whether
for better or worse, the nation had ceased to be
either British or colonial, or provincial, in its character.
In the delightful Rip Van Winkle of a
later Jefferson, during the twenty years' sleep,
the old Dutch house has gone, the peasant's dress,
the quaint inn with its village tapster, all the old
scene of loyal provincial life. Rip returns to a
noisy, boastful, self-assertive town full of American
"push" and "drive," and profane disregard
of superiors and everything ancient. It was
hardly a less change which spread through the
United States in the twenty years of Jefferson's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
unrivaled and fruitful leadership. Superstitious
regard for the "well-born," for institutions of
government as images of veneration apart from
their immediate and practical use; the faith in
government as essentially a financial establishment
which ought to be on peculiarly friendly relations
with banks and bankers; the treatment and consideration
of our democratic organization as an
experiment to be administered with deprecatory
deference to European opinion; the idea that
upon the great, simple elements of political belief
and practice, the mass of men could not judge as
wisely and safely as the opulent, the cultivated,
the educated; the idea that it was a capital feature
of political art to thwart the rashness and
incompetence of the lower people,&mdash;all these theories
and traditions, which had firmly held most
of the disciplined thought of Europe and America,
and to which the lurid horrors of the French Revolution
had brought apparent consecration,&mdash;all
these had now gone; all had been fatally wounded,
or were sullenly and apologetically cherished in
the aging bitterness of the Federalists. There
was an American people with as distinct, as powerful,
as characteristic a polity as belonged to the
British islanders. In 1776 a youthful genius had
seized upon a colonial revolt against taxation as
the occasion to make solemn declaration of a
seeming abstraction about human rights. He had
submitted, however, to subordinate his theory during
the organization of national defense and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
strengthening of the framework of government.
Nor did he shine in either of those works. But
with the nation established, with a union secured
so that its people could safely attend to the simpler
elements of human rights, Jefferson and his disciples
were able to lead Americans to the temper,
the aspirations, and the very prejudices of essential
democracy. The Declaration of Independence,
the ten amendments to the Constitution
theoretically formulating the rights of men or of
the States, sank deep into the sources of American
political life. So completely indeed was the work
done, that in 1820 there was but one political party
in America; all were Jeffersonian Republicans;
and when the Republican party was broken up in
1824, the only dispute was whether Adams or
Jackson or Crawford or Clay or Calhoun best represented
the political beliefs now almost universal.
It seemed to Americans as if they had never
known any other beliefs, as if these doctrines of
their democracy were truisms to which the rest
of the world was marvelously blind.</p>

<p>Nothing in American public life has, in prolonged
anger and even savage desperation, equaled
the attacks upon Jefferson during the steady
growth of his stupendous influence. The hatred
of him personally, and the belief in the wickedness
of his private and public life, survive in our
time. Nine tenths of the Americans who then
read books sincerely thought him an enemy of
mankind and of all that was sacred. Nine tenths<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the authors of American books on history or
politics have to this day written under the influence
which ninety years ago controlled their predecessors.
And for this there is no little reason.
As the American people grew conscious of their
own peculiar and intensely active political force,
there came to them a period of national and popular
life in which much was unlovely, much was
crude, much was disagreeably vulgar. Books
upon America written by foreign travelers, from
the days of Jefferson down to our civil war, superficial
and offensive as they often were, told a great
deal of truth. We do not now need to wince at
criticisms upon a rawness, an insolent condescension
towards the political ignorance of foreigners
and the unhappy subjects of kings, a harshness in
the assertion of the equality of Caucasian men,
and a restless, boastful manner. The criticisms
were in great measure just. But the critics were
stupid and blind not to see the vast and vital work
and change going on before their eyes, to chiefly
regard the trifling and incidental things which
disgusted them. Their eyes were open to all our
faults of taste and manner, but closed to the self-dependent
and self-assertive energy the disorder of
whose exhibition would surely pass away. In
every democratic experiment, in every experiment
of popular or national freedom, there is almost

of dignity in details, which disturbs men who find

and their disgust is too often directed against beneficent
political changes or reforms. If one were
to judge the political temper of the American people
from many of our own writers, and still more
if he were to judge it from the observations even
of intelligent and friendly foreigners prior to 1861,
he would believe that temper to be sordid, mean,
noisy, boastful, and even cruel. But from the war
of 1812 with England to the election of Buchanan
in 1856, the American people had been doing a
profound, organic, democratic work. Meantime
many had seen no more than the unsightly, the
mean and trivial, the malodorous details, which
were mere incidents and blemishes of hidden and
dynamic operations. Unimaginative minds usually
fail to see the greater and deeper movements of
politics as well as those of science. In the public
virtues then maturing there lay the ability long
and strenuously to conduct an enterprise the
greatest which modern times have known, and
an extraordinary popular capacity for restraint
and discipline. In those virtues was sleeping a
tremendously national spirit which, with cost and
sacrifice not to be measured by the vast figures of
the statistician, on one side sought independence,
and on the other saved the Union,&mdash;an exalted
love of men and truth and liberty, which, after all
the enervations of pecuniary prosperity, endured
with patience hardships and losses, and the less
heroic but often more dangerous distresses of taxation,&mdash;at
the North a magnanimity in victory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
unequaled in the traditions of men, and at the
South a composure and dignity and absence of
either bitterness or meanness which brought out
of defeat far larger treasures than could have
come with victory. But these were not effects
without a cause. In them all was only the fruit,
the normal fruit, of the political habits, ideals,
traditions, whose early and unattractive disorders
had chagrined many of the best of Americans, and
had seemed so natural to foreigners who feared or
distrusted a democracy. There had been forming,
during forty or fifty years of a certain raw
unloveliness, the peculiar and powerful self-reliance
of a people whose political independence meant far
more than a mere separate government.</p>

<p>In these years Van Buren was one of the chief
men in American public life. He and his political
associates had been profoundly affected by the Jeffersonian
philosophy of government. They robustly
held its tenets until the flame and vengeance of the
slavery conflict drove them from political power.
In our own day we have, in the able speeches with
which Samuel J. Tilden fatigued respectful though
often unsympathetic hearers at Democratic meetings,
heard something of the same robust political
philosophy, brought directly from intercourse with
his famous neighbor and political master. Van
Buren himself breathed it as the very atmosphere
of American public life, during his early career
which had just begun when Jefferson, his robes
of office dropped and his faults of administration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
forgotten, seemed the serene, wise old man presiding
over a land completely won to his ideals of
democracy. Under this extraordinary influence
and in this political light, there opened with the
first years of the century the public life to be narrated
in this volume.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="ft80">EARLY YEARS.&mdash;PROFESSIONAL LIFE</span></h2>


<p>At the close of the American Revolution, Abraham
Van Buren was a farmer on the east bank of
the Hudson River, New York. He was of Dutch
descent, as was his wife, whose maiden name Hoes,
corrupted from Goes, is said to have had distinction
in Holland. But it would be mere fancy to find in
the statesman particular traits brought from the
dyked swamp lands whence some of his ancestors
came. Those who farmed the rich fields of Columbia
county were pretty thorough Americans; their
characteristics were more immediately drawn from
the soil they cultivated and from the necessary
habits of their life than from the lands, Dutch or
English, from which their forefathers had emigrated.
Late in the eighteenth century they were
no longer frontiersmen. For a century and more
this eastern Hudson River country had been peacefully
and prosperously cultivated. There was no
lack of high spirit; but it was shown in lawsuits
and political feuds rather than in skirmishes with
red men. It was close to the old town of Albany
with its official and not undignified life, and had
comparatively easy access to New York by sloop or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the post-road. It had been an early settlement of
the colony. Within its borders were now the estates
and mansions of large landed proprietors, who
inherited or acquired from a more varied and affluent
life some of the qualities, good and bad, of a
country gentry. It was a region of easy, orderly
comfort, sound and robust enough, but not sharing
the straight and precise, though meddling, puritanical
habits which a few miles away, over the high
Berkshire hills, had come from the shores of New
England.</p>

<p>The elder Van Buren was said by his son's enemies
to have kept a tavern; and he probably did.
Farming and tavern-keeping then were fairly interchangeable;
and the gracious manner, the tact
with men, which the younger Van Buren developed
to a marked degree, it is easy to believe came
rather from the social and varied life of an inn
than from the harsher isolation of a farm. The
statesman's boyish days were at any rate spent
among poor neighbors. He was born at Kinderhook,
an old village of New York, on the 5th of
December, 1782. The usual years of schooling
were probably passed in one of the dilapidated,
weather-beaten schoolhouses from which has come
so much of what is best in American life. He
studied later in the Kinderhook Academy, one of
the higher schools which in New York have done
good work, though not equaling the like schools in
Massachusetts. Here he learned a little Latin.
But when at fourteen years of age he entered a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
law office, he had of course the chief discipline of
book-learning still to acquire. In 1835 his campaign
biographer rather rejoiced that he had so
little systematic education, fearing that "from the
eloquent pages of Livy, or the honeyed eulogiums
of Virgil, or the servile adulation of Horace, he
might have been inspired with an admiration for
regal pomp and aristocratic dignity uncongenial to
the native independence of his mind," and have
imbibed a "contempt for plebeians and common
people," unless, perhaps, the speeches of popular
leaders in Livy "had kindled his instinctive love
of justice and freedom," or the sarcastic vigor of
Tacitus "had created in his bosom a fixed hatred
of tyranny in every shape." At an early age,
however, it is certain that Van Buren, like many
other Americans of original force and with instinctive
fondness for written pictures of human history
and conduct, acquired an education which, though
not that of a professional scholar, was entirely
appropriate to the skillful man of affairs or the
statesman to be set in conspicuous places. This
work must have been largely done during the comparative
leisure of his legal apprenticeship.</p>

<p>It was in 1796 that he entered the law office of
Francis Sylvester at Kinderhook, where he remained
until his twentieth year. He there read
law. It is safe to say besides that he swept the
office, lighted the fires in winter, and, like other
law students in earlier and simpler days, had to do
the work of an office janitor and errand boy, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
well as to serve papers and copy the technical
forms of the common law, and the tedious but
often masterly pleadings of chancery. That his
work as a student was done with great industry
and thoroughness is demonstrated by the fact that
at an early age he became a successful and skillful
advocate in arguments addressed to courts as distinguished
from juries, a division of professional
work in which no skill and readiness will supply
deficiencies in professional equipment. His early
reputation for cleverness is illustrated by the story
that when only a boy he successfully summed up a
case before a jury against his preceptor Sylvester,
being made by the justice to stand upon a bench
because he was so small, with the exhortation,
"There, Mat, beat your master."</p>

<p>In 1802 Van Buren entered the office of William
P. Van Ness, in the city of New York, to
complete his seventh and final year of legal study.
Van Ness was himself from Columbia county and
an eminent lawyer. He was afterwards appointed
United States district judge by Madison; and was
then an influential Republican and a close friend
and defender of Aaron Burr, then the vice-president.
The native powers and fascination of Burr
were at their zenith, though his political character
was blasted. Van Buren made his acquaintance,
and was treated with the distinguished and flattering
attention which the wisest of public men often
show to young men of promise. Van Buren's enemies
were absurdly fond of the fancy that in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
slight intercourse he had acquired the skill and
grace of his manner, and the easy principles and
love of intrigue which they ascribe to him. Burr,
for years after he was utterly disabled, inspired a
childish terror in American politics. The mystery
and dread about him were used by the opponents
of Jackson because Burr had early pointed him
out for the presidency, and by the opponents of
Clay because in early life he had given Burr professional
assistance. But upon Burr's candidacy
for governor in 1804 Van Buren's freedom from
his influence was clearly enough exhibited.</p>

<p>In 1803 Van Buren, being now of age and admitted
as an attorney, returned to Kinderhook and
there began the practice of his profession. The
rank of counsellor-at-law was still distinct and
superior to that of attorney. His half-brother on
his mother's side, James J. Van Alen, at once admitted
the young attorney to a law partnership.
Van Alen was considerably older and had a practice
already established. Van Buren's career as a
lawyer was not a long one, but it was brilliant and
highly successful. After his election to the United
States Senate in 1821 his practice ceased to be
very active. He left his profession with a fortune
which secured him the ease in money matters so
helpful and almost necessary to a man in public
life. Merely professional reputations disappear
with curious and rather saddening promptness and
completeness. Of the practice and distinction
reached by Van Buren before he withdrew from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the bar, although they were unsurpassed in the
State, no vestige and few traditions remain beyond
technical synopses of his arguments in the instructive
but hardly succulent pages of Johnson's, Wendell's,
and Cowen's reports.</p>

<p>At an early day the legal profession reached in
our country a consummate vigor. Far behind as
Americans were in other learning and arts, they
had, within a few years after they escaped colonial
dependence, judges, advocates, and commentators
of the first rank. Marshall, Kent, and Story were
securely famous when hardly another American of
their time not in public and political life was
known. In the legal art Americans were even
more accomplished than in its science; and Columbia
county and the valley of the Hudson were
fine fields for legal practice. Many animosities
survived from revolutionary days. The landed
families, long used to administer the affairs of
others as well as their own, saw with jealousy and
fear the rapid spread of democratic doctrines and
of leveling and often insolent manners. Political
feuds were rife, and frequently appeared in the
professionally profitable collisions of neighbors with
vagrant cows, or on watercourses insufficient for
the needs of the up-stream and the down-stream
proprietors. There were slander suits and libel
suits, and suits for malicious prosecution. Into
the most legitimate controversies over doubts
about property there was driven the bitterness
which turns a lawsuit from a process to ascertain a
right into a weapon of revenge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Buren's political opinions were strong and
clear from the beginning of his law practice; but
he was in a professional minority among the rich
Federalists of the county. The adverse discipline
was invaluable. Through zeal and skill and large
industry, he soon led the Republicans as their
ablest lawyer, and the lawyers of Columbia county
were famous. William W. Van Ness, afterwards
a judge of the supreme court of the State, Grosvenor,
Elisha Williams, and Jacob R. Van Rensselaer
were active at the bar. Williams, although
his very name is nowadays hardly known, we cannot
doubt from the universal testimony of contemporaries,
had extraordinary forensic talents.
He was a Federalist; and the most decisive proof
of Van Buren's rapid professional growth was his
promotion to be Williams's chief competitor and
adversary. Van Buren's extraordinary application
and intellectual clearness soon established him as
the better and the more successful lawyer, though
not the more powerful advocate. Williams at last
said to his rival, "I get all the verdicts, and you
get all the judgments." A famous pupil of Van
Buren both in law and in politics, Benjamin F.
Butler, afterwards attorney-general in his cabinet,
finely contrasted them from his own recollection
of their conflicts when he was a law student.
"Never," he said, "were two men more dissimilar.
Both were eloquent; but the eloquence of Williams
was declamatory and exciting, that of Van Buren
insinuating and delightful. Williams had the live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>lier
imagination, Van Buren the sounder judgment.
The former presented the strong points of his case
in bolder relief, invested them in a more brilliant
coloring, indulged a more unlicensed and magnificent
invective, and gave more life and variety to
his arguments by his peculiar wit and inimitable
humor. But Van Buren was his superior in analyzing,
arranging, and combining the insulated
materials, in comparing and weighing testimony,
in unraveling the web of intricate affairs, in eviscerating
truth from the mass of diversified and
conflicting evidence, in softening the heart and
moulding it to his purpose, and in working into
the judgments of his hearers the conclusions of his
own perspicuous and persuasive reasonings." Most
of this is applicable to Van Buren's career on the
wider field of politics; and much here said of his
early adversary on the tobacco-stained floors of
country court-houses might have been as truly said
of a later adversary of his, the splendid leader who,
rather than Harrison, ought to have been victor
over Van Buren in 1840, and over whom Van
Buren rather than Polk ought to have been victor
in 1844.</p>

<p>In a few years Van Buren outgrew the professional
limitations of Kinderhook. In February,
1807, he had been admitted as a counsellor of the
supreme court; and this promotion he most happily
celebrated by marrying Hannah Hoes, a young
lady of his own age, and also of Dutch descent, a
kinswoman of his mother, and with whom he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
been intimate from his childhood. In 1808, the
council of appointment becoming Republican, he
was made surrogate of Columbia county, succeeding
his partner and half-brother Van Alen, a Federalist
in politics, who was, however, returned to
the place in 1815, when the Federalists regained
the council. The office was a respectable one,
concerned with the probate of wills, and the ordering
of estates of deceased persons. Within a year
after this appointment, Van Buren removed to the
new and bustling little city of Hudson, directly on
the river banks. Here he practiced law with
rapidly increasing success for seven years. His
pecuniary thrift now enabled him to purchase
what was called "a very extensive and well-selected
library." With this advantage he applied himself
to "a systematic and extended course of reading,"
which left him a well, even an amply, educated
man. His severity in study did not, however, exclude
him from the social pleasures of which he
was fond, and for which he was perfectly fitted.
He learned men quite as fast as he learned books.
A country surrogate, though then enjoying fees,
since commuted to a salary, had only a meagre
compensation. But the duties of Van Buren's
office did not interfere with his activity in the
private practice of the law. On the contrary,
the office enabled him to make acquaintances, a
process which, even without adventitious aid, he
always found easy and delightful.</p>

<p>In 1813, having been elected a member of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Senate of the State, he became as such a member
of the court for the correction of errors. This
was the court of last resort, composed, until 1847,
of the chancellor, the judges of the supreme court,
the lieutenant-governor, and the thirty-two senators.
The latter, though often laymen, were members
of the court, partly through a curious imitation
of the theoretical function of the British House of
Lords, and partly under the idea, even now feebly
surviving in some States, that some besides lawyers
ought to sit upon the bench in law courts to contribute
the common sense which it was fancied
might be absent from their more learned associates.
It was not found unsuitable for members of this,
the highest court, to be active legal practitioners.
While Van Buren held his place as a member he
was, in February, 1815, made attorney-general,
succeeding Abraham Van Vechten, one of the
famous lawyers of the State. Van Buren was then
but thirty-two years old, and the professional eminence
accorded to the station was greater than
now. Among near predecessors in it had been
Aaron Burr, Ambrose Spencer and Thomas Addis
Emmett; among his near successors were Thomas
J. Oakley, Samuel A. Talcott, Greene C. Bronson
and Samuel Beardsley,&mdash;all names of the first
distinction in the professional life of New York.
The office was of course political, as it has always
been, both in the United States and the mother
country. But Van Buren's appointment, if it were
made because he was an active and influential Re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>publican
in politics, would still not have been made
unless his professional reputation had been high.
The salary was $5.50 a day, with some costs,&mdash;not
an unsuitable salary in days when the chancellor
was paid but $3000 a year. He held the office
until July, 1819, when, upon the capture of the
council of appointment by a coalition of Clintonian
Republicans and Federalists, he was removed to
give place to Oakley, the Federalist leader in the
State Assembly.</p>

<p>In 1816 Van Buren, now rapidly reaching professional
eminence, removed to Albany, the capital
of New York. Though then a petty city of mean
buildings and about 10,000 inhabitants, it had a
far larger relative importance in the professional
and social life of the State than has the later city
of ten times the population, with its costly and
enormous state-house, its beautiful public buildings,
and its steep and numerous streets of fine residences.
In 1820 he purposed removing to New
York; but, for some reason altering his plans, continued
to reside at Albany until appointed secretary
of state in 1829. His professional career was there
crowned with most important and lucrative work.
Soon after moving to Albany, he took into partnership
Butler, just admitted to the bar. Between
the two men there were close and life-long relations.
The younger of them, also a son of Columbia
county, reached great professional distinction, became
a politician of the highest type, and remained
steadfast in his attachment to Van Buren's political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
fortunes, and to the robust and distinctly marked
political doctrines and practices of the Albany
Regency.</p>

<p>The law reports give illustrations of Van Buren's
precision, his clear and forcible common-sense, and
his aptitude for that learning of the law in which
the great counsel of the time excelled. In 1813,
soon after his service began as state senator, he delivered
an opinion in a case of "escape;" and in
very courteous words exhibited a bit of his dislike
for Kent, then chief justice of the supreme court,
whose judgment he helped to reverse, as well as
his antipathy to imprisonment for debt, which he
afterwards helped to abolish. It was a petty suit
against the sureties upon the bond given by a debtor.
Under a relaxation of the imprisonment for debt
recently permitted, the debtor was, on giving the
bond, released from jail, but upon the condition
that he should keep within the "jail liberties,"
which in the country counties was a prescribed area
around the jail. His bond was to be forfeit if he
passed the "liberties." While the debtor was
driving a cow to or from pasture, the latter contemptuously
deviated "four, six, or ten feet" from
the liberties. The driver, yielding to inevitable
bucolic impulse and forgetting his bond, leaped over
the imaginary line to bring back the cow. He was
without the liberties but a moment, and afterwards
duly kept within them. But the creditor was watchful,
and for the technical "escape" sued the sureties.
Although the debtor was within the limits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
when suit was brought, the lower court refused to
pardon the debtor's technical and unintentional
fault. At common law the creditor was entitled to
satisfaction of the debtor's body; and the milder
statute establishing jail liberties was, the court said,
to be strictly construed against the debtor; it was
not enough that the creditor had the debtor's body
when he called for it. The supreme court, headed
by Kent, affirmed this curiously harsh decision. In
the court of errors, Van Buren joined Chancellor
Lansing in reversing the rule upon an elaborate review
of the law, which to this day is important authority,
and which could not have been more carefully
done had something greater seemed at stake
than a bovine vagary and a few dollars. The young
lawyer, wearing for a time the judicial robes, now
sat in a review, by no means unpleasant, of the utterances
of magistrates before whom he had until
then stood in considerable awe; and seized the opportunity,
doubtless with a keen perception of the drift
of popular sentiment on matters of personal liberty,
to enlarge the mild policy of the later law. When
it was urged that, if the law were not technically administered,
imprisoned debtors would of a Sunday
wander beyond the "limits," securely able to return
before Monday, when the creditor could sue,&mdash;Van
Buren, with a contemptuous fling at the supreme
court, confessed in Johnsonian sentences his lenient
temper towards these "stolen pleasures,"&mdash;his
willingness that debtors should snatch the "few
moments of liberty which, although soured by con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>stant
perturbation and alarm, are, notwithstanding,
deemed fit subjects for judicial animadversion."
His rhetoric was rather agreeably florid when he
declared the law establishing "jail liberties" to be
a concession for humane purposes made by the inflexible
spirit which authorized imprisonment for
debt. He strongly intimated his sympathy to be
with "the exertions of men of intelligence, reflection,
and philanthropy to mitigate its rigor; of men
who viewed it as a practice fundamentally wrong,
a practice which forces their fellow-creatures from
society, from their friends, and their agonized families
into the dreary walls of a prison; which compels
them to leave all those fascinating endearments
to become an inmate with vermin;" and all this,
not for crime or frauds, "but for the misfortune of
being poor, of being unable to satisfy the all-digesting
stomach of some ravenous creditor." The practice
was one "confounding virtue and vice, and destroying
the distinction between guilt and innocence
which should unceasingly be cherished in every
well-regulated government." Democrats rejoiced
over this passage when Van Buren was a candidate
for the presidency. Richard M. Johnson, then his
associate upon the Democratic ticket, had successfully
led an agitation for the abolition of such imprisonment
upon judgments rendered in the federal
courts.</p>

<p>Van Buren's professional life terminated with
his election as governor in 1828. In 1830, while
secretary of state at Washington, he is said to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
appeared before the federal supreme court in the
great litigation between Astor and the Sailors' Snug
Harbor, in which he had been counsel below; but
no record is preserved of his argument there. His
last well-known argument was before the court of
errors at Albany in Varick v. Jackson, a branch of
the famous Medcef Eden litigation. This long and
highly technical battle was lighted up by the fame
and competitions of the counsel. It arose upon the
question whether a will of Eden which gave a landed
estate to his son Joseph, but if Joseph died without
children, then to his surviving brother, Medcef Eden
the younger, created for Joseph the old lawyers'
delight of an "estate tail." If it were an "estate
tail," then the law of 1782, which, in the general
tendency of American legislation after the Revolution,
was directed against the entailing of property,
would have made the first brother, Joseph, the absolute
owner, and have defeated the later claim of
Medcef. Joseph had failed while in possession of
the property. His creditors, accepting the opinion
of Alexander Hamilton, then the head of the bar,
insisted that he had been the absolute owner, that
the provision for his brother Medcef's accession to
the property was nugatory as an attempt to entail
the estate; and upon this view the creditors sold
the lands, which by the rapid growth of the city
soon became of large value. Hamilton's opinion
for years daunted the younger Medcef and his children
from asserting the right which it was morally
plain his father had intended for him. Aaron Burr,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
not less Hamilton's rival at the bar than in the politics
of New York, gave a contrary opinion; but
after killing Hamilton in 1804 and yielding up the
vice-presidency in 1805, his brilliant professional
gifts were exiled from New York. On his return
in 1812 from years of conspiracy, adventure, and
romance, he took up the discredited Medcef Eden
claim; and in the judicial test of the question he,
and not Hamilton, proved to have been correct.
The struggle went on in a number of suits; and
when in 1823 the question was to be finally settled
in the court of last resort, Burr, fearing, as he himself
intimated to the court, lest the profound suspicion
under which he rested might obscure and
break the force of his legal arguments, or conscious
that his past twenty years had dimmed his faculties,
called to his aid Van Buren, then United States
senator and a chief of the profession. As Van
Buren and Burr attended together before the court
of errors, they doubtless recalled their meetings in
Van Ness's office twenty years before, when Burr,
still a splendid though clouded figure in American
life, hoped, by Federalist votes added to the Republican
secession which he led, to reach the governorship
and recover his prestige; those days in which
the unknown but promising young countryman had
interested a vice-president and enjoyed the latter's
skillful and not always insincere flattery. The firm
and orderly procedure of Van Buren's life was now
well contrasted with the discredited and profligate
ability of the returned wanderer. Against this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
earlier but long deposed, and against this later and
regnant chief in the Republican politics of New
York, were ranged in these cases David B. Ogden,
the famous lawyer of the Federalist ranks, Samuel
A. Talcott, and Samuel Jones. In Van Buren's
long, masterly, and successful argument there was
again an edge to the zeal with which he attacked
the opinion of Kent, the Federalist chancellor, who
asked the court of errors to overrule its earlier decisions,
and the chancellor's own decision as well,
and defeat the intention of the elder Medcef Eden.</p>

<p>Van Buren's professional career was most enviable.
It lasted twenty-five years. It ended before
he was forty-six, when he was in the early ripeness
of his powers, but not until a larger and more shining
career seemed surely opened before him. He
left the bar with a competence fairly earned, which
his prudence and skill made grow into an ample
fortune, without even malicious suggestion in the
scurrility of politics that he had profited out of
public offices. In money matters he was more
thrifty and cautious than most Americans in public
places. His enemies accused him of meanness and
parsimony, but apparently without other reason
than that he did not practice the careless and useless
profusion and luxury which many of his countrymen
in political life have thought necessary to
indulge even when their own tastes were far simpler.
In the course of professional employment he acquired
an important estate near Oswego, whose
value rapidly enhanced with the rapid growth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
western New York and the development of the lake
commerce from that port.</p>

<p>The chief interest now found in Van Buren's professional
career lies in its relation to his political
life. He was the only lawyer of conspicuous and
practical and really great professional success who
has reached the White House. In the long preparation
for the bar, in the many hours of leisure at
Kinderhook and Hudson and even Albany permitted
by the methods of practice in vogue before
there were railways or telegraphs, and when travel
was costly and slow and postage a shilling or more,
he gained the liberal education more difficult of
access to the busier young attorney and counsel of
these crowded days. Great lawyers were then
fond of illustrations from polite literature; they
loved to set off their speeches with quotations from
the classics, and to give their style finish and ornament
not practicable to the precise, prompt methods
which their successors learn in the driving routine
of modern American cities. Van Buren did not,
however, become a great orator at the bar. His admirer,
Butler, upon returning to partnership with
him in 1820, wrote indeed to an intimate friend,
Jesse Hoyt (destined afterwards to bring grief and
scandal upon both the partners), that if he were
Van Buren he "would let politics alone," and become,
as Van Buren might, the "Erskine of the
State." But though his success, had he continued
in the profession, would doubtless have been of the
very first order, his oratory would never have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
reached the warm and virile splendor of Erskine,
or the weighty magnificence of Webster. Van
Buren's work as a lawyer brought him, however,
something besides wealth and the education and
refinement of books, and something which neither
Erskine nor Webster gained. The profession afforded
him an admirable discipline in the conduct
of affairs; and affairs, in the law as out of it, are
largely decided by human nature and its varying
peculiarities. The preparation of details; the keen
and far-sighted arrangement of the best, because
the most practicable, plan; the refusal to fire off
ammunition for the popular applause to be roused
by its noise and flame; the clear, steady bearing in
mind of the end to be accomplished, rather than
the prolonged enjoyment or systematic working out
of intermediate processes beyond a utilitarian necessity,&mdash;all
these elements Van Buren mastered
in a signal degree, and made invaluable in legal
practice. To men more superbly equipped for <i>tours
de force</i>, who ignored the uses of long, attentive,
varied, painstaking work, there was nothing admirable
in the methods which Van Buren brought into
political life out of his experience in the law. He
was, to undisciplined or envious opponents, a "little
magician," a trickster. The same thing appears,
in every department of human activity, in the anger
which failure often flings at success.</p>

<p>The predominance of lawyers in our politics was
very early established, and has been a characteristic
distinction between politics in England and politics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in America. Conspicuous as lawyers have been in
the politics of the older country, they have rarely
been figures of the first rank. They have served
in all its modern ministries, and sometimes in
other than professional stations; but, with the
unimportant exception of Perceval, not as the
chief. English opinion has not unjustly believed
its greater landed proprietors to be animated with
a strong and peculiar desire for English greatness
and renown; nor has the belief been destroyed by
their frequent opposition to the most beneficent
popular movements. Among these proprietors and
those allied with them, even when not strictly in
their ranks, England has found her statesmen. To
this day, the speech of a lawyer in the British
House of Commons is fancied to show the narrowness
of technical training, or is treated as a bid
for promotion to some of the splendid seats open
to the English bar. In America, the great landed
proprietor very early lost the direction of public
affairs. All the members of the "Virginian dynasty"
were, it is true, large land-owners, and in
the politics of New York there were several of
them. But land-ownership was to Jefferson, Madison,
and Monroe simply a means of support while
they attended to public affairs; it was not one of
their chief recommendations to the landed interest
throughout the country. For a time in the early
politics of New York the landed wealth of the
Schuylers, Van Rensselaers, and Livingstons was
of itself a source of strength; but in the spread of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
democratic sentiment it was found that to be a
great landlord was entirely consistent with dullness,
narrowness, and timid selfishness. Among
the landlords there soon and inevitably decayed
that sense of public obligation belonging to exalted
position and leadership which sometimes brings
courage, high public spirit, and even a sound and
active political imagination, to those who preside
over bodies of tenants. The laws were changed
which facilitated family accumulations of land.
Since these early years of the century a great
land-owner has been in politics little more than any
other rich man. Both have had advantages in that
as in any other field of activity. Certain easy
graces not uncommon to inherited wealth have
often been popular,&mdash;not, however, for the wealth,
but for themselves. Where these graces have existed
in America without such wealth, they have
been none the less popular; but in England a lifetime
of vast public service and the finest personal
attainments have failed to overcome the distrust of
a landless man as a sort of adventurer.</p>

<p>When Van Buren's career began, the men who
were making money in trade or manufactures were
generally too busy for the anxious and busy cares
of public life; the tradesmen and manufacturers
who had already made money were past the time
of life when men can vigorously and skillfully turn
to a new and strange calling. There was no leisure
class except land-owners or retired men of
business. Lawyers, far more than those of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
other calling, became public men, and naturally
enough. Their experience of life and their knowledge
of men were large. The popular interest in
their art of advocacy; their travels from county
seat to county seat; their speeches to juries in
towns where no other secular public speaking was
to be heard; the varieties of human life which
lawyers came to know,&mdash;varieties far greater
where the same men acted as attorneys and advocates
than in England where they acted in only one
of these fields,&mdash;these and the like, combined with
the equipment for the forms of political and governmental
work which was naturally gained in
legal practice and the systematic study of law, gave
to distinguished lawyers in America their large
place in its political life. For this place the liberality
of their lives helped, besides, to fit them.
They had ceased to be disqualified for it by their
former close alliance, as in England, with the
landed aristocracy; and they had not yet begun to
suffer a disqualification, frequently unjust, for
their close relations with corporate interests, between
which and the public there often arises an
antagonism of interests. De Tocqueville, after his
visit in 1832, said that lawyers formed in America
its highest political class and the most cultivated
circle of society; that the American aristocracy
was not composed of the rich, but that it occupied
the judicial bench and the bar. And the descriptions
of the liberal and acute though theoretical
Frenchman are generally trustworthy, however<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
often his striking generalizations are at fault.
Such, then, was the intimacy of relations between
the professions of law and politics when Van Buren
shone in both. And when, in his early prime, he
gave up the law, neither forensic habits nor those
of the attorney were yet too strongly set to permit
the easy and complete diversion of his powers to
the more generous and exalted activity of public
life.</p>

<p>It is simpler thus separately to treat Van Buren's
life as a lawyer, because in a just view of the man
it must be subordinate to his life as a politician.
It is to be remembered, however, that in his earlier
years his progress in politics closely attended in
time, and in much more than time, his professional
progress. When, at thirty, he sat as an appellate
judge in the court of errors, he was already powerful
in politics; when, at thirty-two, he was attorney-general,
he was the leader of his party in the state
senate; when, at forty-five, he had perhaps the
most lucrative professional practice in New York,
he was the leader of his party in the United States
Senate. But it will be easier to follow his political
career without interruption from his work as a
lawyer, honorable and distinguished as it was, and
much of his political ability as he owed to its fine
discipline.</p>

<p>Van Buren's domestic life was broken up by the
death of his wife at Albany, in February, 1819,
leaving him four sons. To her memory Van Buren
remained scrupulously loyal until his own death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
forty-three years afterwards. We may safely believe
political enemies when, after saying of him
many dastardly things, they admitted that he had
been an affectionate husband. Nor were accusations
ever made against the uprightness and purity
of his private life.</p>

<span class="ft80">STATE SENATOR.&mdash;ATTORNEY-GENERAL.&mdash;MEMBER
OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</span></h2>


<p>The politics of New York State were never more
bitter, never more personal, than when Van Buren
entered the field in 1803. The Federalists were
sheltered by the unique and noble prestige of
Washington's name; and were conscious that in
wealth, education, refinement, they far excelled the
Republicans. They were contemptuously suspicious
of the unlettered ignorance, the intense and
exuberant vanity, of the masses of American men.
It was by that contempt and suspicion that they
invited the defeat which, protected though they
were by the property qualifications required of
voters in New York, they met in 1800 at the hands
of a people in whom the instincts of democracy
were strong and unsubmissive. This was in our
history the one complete and final defeat of a great
national party while in power. The Federalists
themselves made it final,&mdash;by their silly and unworthy
anger at a political reverse; by their profoundly
immoral efforts to thwart the popular will
and make Burr president; by their fatal and
ingrained disbelief in common men, who, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
thought, foolishly and impiously refused to accept
wisdom and guidance from the possessors of learning
and great estates; and finally by their unpatriotic
opposition to Jefferson and Madison in the
assertion of American rights on the seas during
the Napoleonic wars. All these drove the party,
in spite of its large services in the past and its
eminent capacity for service in the future, forever
from the confidence of the American people. The
Federalists maintained, it is true, a party organization
in New York until after the second war with
England; but their efforts were rather directed to
the division and embarrassment of their adversaries
than to victories of their own strength or upon
their own policy. They carried the lower house
of the legislature in 1809, 1812, and 1813. There
were among them men of the first rank, who retained
a strong hold on popular respect, among
whom John Jay and Rufus King were deservedly
shining figures. But never after 1799 did the
Federalists elect in New York a governor, or control
both legislative houses, or secure any solid
power, except by coalition with one branch or another
of the Republicans.</p>

<p>Van Buren's fondness for politics was soon developed.
His father was firmly attached to the
Jeffersonians or Republicans,&mdash;a rather discredited
minority among the Federalists of Columbia
county and the estates of the Hudson River aristocracy.
Inheriting his political preferences, Van
Buren, with a great body of other young Ameri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>cans,
caught the half-doctrinaire enthusiasm which
Jefferson then inspired, an enthusiasm which in
Van Buren was to be so enduring a force, and to
which sixty years later he was still as loyal as he
had been in the hot disputes on the sanded floors
of the village store or tavern. During these boyish
years he wrote and spoke for his party; and before
he was eighteen he was formally appointed a delegate
to a Republican convention for Columbia and
Rensselaer counties.</p>

<p>Van Buren returned from New York to Columbia
county late in 1803, just twenty-one years old.
At once he became active in politics. The Republican
party, though not strong in his county, was
dominant in the State; and the game of politics
was played between its different factions, the Federalists
aiding one or the other as they saw their
advantage. The Republicans were Clintonians,
Livingstonians, or Burrites. George Clinton, in
whose career lay the great origin of party politics
of New York, was the Republican leader. The
son of an Irish immigrant, he had, without the aid
of wealth or influential connections, made himself
the most popular man in the State. He was the
first governor after colonial days were over, and
was repeatedly re&euml;lected. It was his opposition
which most seriously endangered New York's adoption
of the Federal Constitution. But in spite of
the wide enthusiasm which the completed Union
promptly aroused, this opposition did not prevent
his re&euml;lection in 1789 and 1792. The majorities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
were small, however, it being even doubtful whether
in the latter year the majority were fairly given
him. In 1795 he declined to be a candidate, and
Robert R. Livingston, the Republican in his place,
was defeated. In 1801 Clinton was again elected.
Later he was vice-president in Jefferson's second
term and Madison's first term; and his aspiration
to the presidency in 1808 was by no means unreasonable.
He was a strong party leader and a
sincerely patriotic man. The Livingston family
interest in New York was very great. The chancellor,
Robert R. Livingston, who nowadays is
popularly associated with the ceremony of Washington's
inauguration, had been secretary for foreign
affairs under the Articles of Confederation,
and had left the Federalists in 1790. After his
sixty years had under the law disqualified him for
judicial office, he became Jefferson's minister to
France and negotiated with Bonaparte the Louisiana
treaty. Brockholst Livingston was a judge
of the Supreme Court of New York in 1801. In
1807 Jefferson promoted him to the federal Supreme
Court. Edward Livingston, younger than
his brother, the chancellor, by seventeen years,
was long after to be one of the finest characters in
our politics. Early in Washington's administration
he had become a strong pro-French Republican,
and had opposed Jay's treaty with Great Britain;
though forty years later, when Jackson brought
him from Louisiana to be secretary of state, he
was sometimes reminded of his still earlier Federal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ism.
Morgan Lewis, judge of the Supreme Court
and afterwards chief justice, and still later governor,
was a brother-in-law of the chancellor. Smith
Thompson, also a judge and chief justice, and later
secretary of the navy under Monroe and a judge
of the federal Supreme Court, and Van Buren's
competitor for governor in 1828, was a connection
of the family. There were sneers at the Livingston
conversion to Democracy as there always are at
political conversions. But whether or not Chancellor
Livingston's Democracy came from jealousy
of Hamilton in 1790, it is at least certain that he
and his family connections rendered political services
of the first importance during a half century.
The drafting of Jackson's nullification proclamation
in 1833 by Edward Livingston was one of the
noblest and most signal services which Americans
have had the fortune to render to their country.</p>

<p>The best offices were largely held by the Clinton
and Livingston families and their connections, an
arrangement very aristocratic indeed, but which
did not then seem inconsistent with efficient and
decorous performance of the public business.
Burr naturally gathered around him those restless,
speculative men who are as immoral in their aspirations
as in their conduct, and whose adherence
has disgraced and weakened almost every democratic
movement known to history. Burr had
been attorney-general; he had refused a seat in
the Supreme Court; he had been United States
senator; and now in the second office of the nation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
he presided with distinguished grace over the Federal
Senate. His hands were not yet red with
Hamilton's blood when Van Buren met him at
New York in 1803; but Democratic faces were
averted from the man who, loaded with its honors
and enjoying its confidence, had intrigued with its
enemies to cheat his exultant party out of their
choice for president. In tribute to the Republicans
of New York, George Clinton had already
been selected in his place to be the next vice-president.
While Van Buren was near the close of
his law studies at New York, Burr was preparing
to restore his fortunes by a popular election, for
which he had some Republican support, and to
which the fatuity of the defeated party, again rejecting
Hamilton's advice, added a considerable
Federalist support. William P. Van Ness, as
"Aristides," one of the classical names under
which our ancestors were fond of addressing the
public, had in the Burr interest written a bitter
attack on the Clintons and Livingstons, accusing
them, and with reason, of dividing the offices between
themselves.</p>

<p>Van Buren was easily proof against the allurements
of Burr, and even the natural influence of
so distinguished a man as Van Ness, with whom
he had been studying a year. Sylvester, his first
preceptor, was a Federalist. So was Van Alen,
his half-brother, soon to be his partner, who in
May, 1806, was elected to Congress. But Van
Buren was firm and resolute in party allegiance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
In the election for governor in April, 1804, Burr
was badly beaten by Morgan Lewis, the Clinton-Livingston
candidate, whom Van Buren warmly
supported, and Burr's political career was closed.
The successful majority of the Republicans was
soon resolved into the Clintonians, led by Clinton
and Judge Ambrose Spencer, and the Livingstonians,
led by Governor Lewis. The active participation
of judges in the bitter politics of the
time illustrates the universal intensity of political
feeling, and goes very far to justify Jefferson's and
Van Buren's distrust of judicial opinions on political
questions. Brockholst Livingston, Smith
Thompson, Ambrose Spencer, Daniel D. Tompkins,&mdash;all
judges of the State Supreme Court,&mdash;did
not cease when they donned the ermine to
be party politicians; neither did the chancellors
Robert R. Livingston and Lansing. Even Kent,
it is pretty obvious, was a man of far stronger and
more openly partisan feelings than we should to-day
think fitting so great a judicial station as he
held. The quarrels over offices were strenuous
and increasing from the very top to the bottom of
the community.</p>

<p>The Federalists in 1807 generally joined the
Lewisites, or "Quids." Governor Lewis, finding
that the jealousy of the Livingston interests would
defeat his renomination by the usual caucus of
Republican members of the legislature, became the
candidate of a public meeting at New York, and
of a minority caucus, and asked help from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Federalists. Such an alliance always seemed monstrous
only to the Republican faction that felt
strong enough without it. The regular legislative
caucus, controlled by the Clintonians, nominated
Daniel D. Tompkins, then a judge of the Supreme
Court, and for years after the Republican "war-horse."
Van Buren adhered to the purer, older,
and less patrician Democracy of the Clintonians.
Tompkins was elected, with a Clintonian legislature;
and the result secured Van Buren's first
appointment to public office. A Clintonian council
of appointment was chosen. The council, a
complex monument of the distrust of executive
power with which George III. had filled his revolted
subjects, was composed of five members,
being the governor and one member from each of
the four senatorial districts, who were chosen by
the Assembly from among the six senators of the
district. The four senatorial members of the
council were always, therefore, of the political
faith of the Assembly, except in cases where all
the senators from a district belonged to the minority
party in the Assembly. To this council
belonged nearly every appointment in the State,
even of local officers. Prior to 1801 the governor
appointed, with the advice and consent of the
council. After the constitutional amendment of
that year, either member of the council could
nominate, the appointment being made by the
majority. Van Buren became surrogate of Columbia
county on February 20, 1808. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
no prescribed term of office, the commission really
running until the opposition party secured the
council of appointment. Van Buren held the
office about five years and until his removal on
March 19, 1813, when his adversaries had secured
control of the council.</p>

<p>At this time the system of removing the lesser
as well as the greater officers of government for
political reasons was well established in New York.
It is impossible to realize the nature of Van Buren's
political education without understanding
this old system of proscription, whose influence
upon American public life has been so prodigious.
The strife over the Federal Constitution had been
fierce. Its friends, after their victory, sought,
neither unjustly nor unnaturally, to punish Governor
Clinton for his opposition. Although Washington
wished to stand neutral between parties,
he still believed it politically suicidal to appoint
officers not in sympathy with his administration.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Hamilton undoubtedly determined the New York
appointments when the new government was
launched, and they were made from the political
enemies of Governor Clinton,&mdash;a course provoking
an animosity which not improbably appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>in the more numerous state appointments controlled
by Clinton and the Republican council. After the
excesses of the French Revolution the Republicans
were denounced as Jacobins and radicals, dangerous
in politics and corrupt in morals. The family
feuds aided and exaggerated the divisions in this
small community of freehold voters. Appointments
were made in the federal and state services for
political reasons and for family reasons, precisely as
they had long been made in England. Especially
along the rich river counties from New York to
the upper Hudson were so distributed the lucrative
offices, which were eagerly sought for their profit
as well as for their honor.</p>

<p>The contests were at first for places naturally
vacated by death or resignation; the idea of the
property right of an incumbent actually in office
lingered until after the last century was out. It is
not clear when the first removals of subordinate
officers took place for political reasons. Some
were made by the Federalists during Governor
Jay's administration; but the first extensive removals
seem to have occurred after the elections of
1801. For this there were two immediate causes.
In that year the exclusive nominating power of the
governor was taken from him. Each of the other
four members of the council of appointment could
now nominate as well as confirm. Appointments
and removals were made, therefore, from that year
until the new Constitution of 1821, by one of the
worst of appointing bodies, a commission of several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
men whose consultations were secret and whose responsibility
was divided. Systematic abuse of the
power of appointment became inevitable. There
was, besides, a second reason in the anger against
Federalists, which they had gone far to provoke,
and against their long and by no means gentle
domination. This anger induced the Republicans
to seek out every method of punishment. But for
this, the abuse might have been long deferred.
Nor is it unlikely that the refusal of Jefferson, inaugurated
in March of that year, to make a "clean
sweep" of his enemies, turned the longing eyes of
embittered Republicans in New York more eagerly
to the fat state offices enjoyed by their insolent
adversaries of the past twelve years.</p>

<p>The Clintons and Livingstons had led the Republicans
to a victory at the state election in
April, 1801. Later in that year George Clinton,
now again governor, called together the new council
with the nominating power vested in every one
of its five members. This council acted under distinguished
auspices, and it deserves to be long remembered.
Governor Clinton presided, and his
famous nephew, De Witt Clinton, was below him
in the board. The latter represented the Clintonian
Republicans.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Ambrose Spencer, a man of
great parts and destined to a notable career, repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>sented
the Livingstons, of whom he was a family
connection. Roseboom, the other Republican, was
easily led by his two abler party associates. The
fifth member did not count, for he was a Federalist.
Two of the three really distinguished men
of this council, De Witt Clinton and Ambrose
Spencer, it is not unjust to say, first openly and
responsibly established in New York the "spoils
system" by removals, for political reasons, of officers
not political. The term of office of the four
senatorial members of this council had commenced
while the illustrious Federalist John Jay was governor;
but they rejected his nominations until he
was tired of making them, and refused to call them
together. When Clinton took the governor's seat,
he promptly summoned the board, and in August,
1801, the work began. De Witt Clinton publicly
formulated the doctrine, but it did not yet reach
its extreme form. He said that the principal executive
offices in the State ought to be filled by
the friends of the administration, and the more
unimportant offices ought to be proportionately
distributed between the two parties. The council
rapidly divided the chief appointments among
the Clintons and Livingstons and their personal
supporters. Officers were selected whom Jay had
refused to appoint. Edward Livingston, the chancellor's
brother, was given the mayoralty of New
York, a very profitable as well as important station;
Thomas Tillotson, a brother-in-law of Chancellor
Livingston, was made secretary of state, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
place of Daniel Hale, removed; John V. Henry, a
distinguished Federalist lawyer, was removed from
the comptrollership; the district attorney, the clerk
and the recorder of New York were removed;
William Coleman, the founder of the "Evening
Post," and a strong adherent of Hamilton, was
turned out of the clerkship of the Circuit Court.
And so the work went on through minor offices.
New commissions were required by the Constitution
to be issued to the puisne judges of the county
courts and to justices of the peace throughout the
State once in three years. Instead of renewing
the commissions and preserving continuity in the
administration of justice, the council struck out
the names of Federalists and inserted those of Republicans.
The proceedings of this council of 1801
have profoundly affected the politics of New York
to this day. Few political bodies in America have
exercised as serious and lasting an influence upon
the political habits of the nation. The tradition
that Van Buren and the Albany Regency began
political proscription is untrue. The system of
removals was thus established several years before
Van Buren held his first office. Its founders, De
Witt Clinton and Ambrose Spencer, were long his
political enemies. Governor Clinton, whose honorable
record it was that during the eighteen years
of his governorship he had never consented to a
political removal, entered his protest&mdash;not a very
hearty one, it is to be feared&mdash;in the journal of
the council; but in vain. In the next year the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
chief offenders were promoted,&mdash;De Witt Clinton
to be United States senator in the place of General
Armstrong, a brother-in-law of Chancellor Livingston,
and Ambrose Spencer to be attorney-general;
and two years later Spencer became a judge of the
Supreme Court.</p>

<p>After the removals there began a disintegration
of the party hitherto successfully led by Burr, the
Clintons, and the Livingstons. Colonel Swartwout,
Burr's friend, was called by De Witt Clinton a liar,
scoundrel and villain; although, after receiving two
bullets from Clinton's pistol in a duel, he was assured
by the latter, with the courtesy of our grandfathers,
that there was no personal animosity.
Burr's friends had of course to be removed. But
in 1805, after the Clintons and the Livingstons had
united in the election of Lewis as governor over
Burr, they too quarreled,&mdash;and naturally enough,
for the offices would not go around. So, after the
Clintonians on the meeting of the legislature early
in 1806 had captured the council, they turned upon
their recent allies. Maturin Livingston was removed
from the New York recordership, and Tillotson
from his place as secretary of state. The
work was now done most thoroughly. Sheriffs,
clerks, surrogates, county judges, justices of the
peace, had to go. But at the corporation election
in New York in the same year, the Livingstonians
and Federalists, with a majority of the common
council, in their fashion righted the wrong, and,
with a vigor not excelled by their successors a half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
century later, removed at once all the subordinate
municipal officers subject to their control who were
Clintonians. In 1807 the Livingstonian Republicans,
or, as they were now called from the governor,
the Lewisites, with the Federalists and Burrites,
secured control of the state council; and proceeded
promptly to the work of removals, defending it as
a legitimate return for the proscriptive course of
their predecessors. In 1808 the Clintonians returned
to the council, and, through its now familiar
labors, to the offices from which the Lewisites
were in their turn driven. In 1810 the Federalists
controlled the Assembly which chose the council;
and they enjoyed a "clean sweep" as keenly as had
the contending Republican factions. But the election
of this year, the political record tells us, taught
a lesson which politicians have ever since refused
to learn, perhaps because it has not always been
taught. The removal of the Republicans from
office "had the natural tendency to call out all their
forces." The Clintonians in 1811, therefore, were
enabled by the people to reverse the Federalist proscription
of 1810. The Federalists, again in power
in 1813, again followed the uniform usage then
twelve years old. Political removals had become
part of the unwritten law.</p>

<p>At this time Van Buren suffered the loss of his
office as surrogate, but doubtless without any sense
of private or public wrong. It was the customary
fate of war. In 1812 he was nominated for state
senator from the middle district, composed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Columbia, Dutchess, Orange, Ulster, Delaware,
Chenango, Greene, and Sullivan counties, as the
candidate of the Clintonian Republicans against
Edward P. Livingston, the candidate of the Lewisites
or Livingstonians and Burrites as well as the
Federalists. Livingston was the sitting member,
and a Republican of powerful family and political
connections. Van Buren, not yet thirty, defeated
him by a majority of less than two hundred out of
twenty thousand votes. In November, 1812, he
took his seat at Albany, and easily and within a
few months reached a conspicuous and powerful
place in state politics.</p>

<p>These details of the establishment of the "spoils
system" in New York politics seem necessary to be
told, that Van Buren's own participation in the
wrong may be fairly judged. It is a common historical
vice to judge the conduct of men of earlier
times by standards which they did not know. Van
Buren found thoroughly and universally established
at Albany, when he entered its life, the rule that,
upon a change in the executive, there should be a
change in the offices, without reference to their political
functions. He had in his own person experienced
its operation both to his advantage and to
his disadvantage. Federalists and Republicans
were alike committed to the rule. The most distinguished
and the most useful men in active public
life, whatever their earlier opinion might have been,
had acquiesced and joined in the practice. Nor
was the practice changed or extended after Van<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Buren came into state politics. It continued as it
had thus begun, until he became a national figure.
Success in it required an ability and skill of which
he was an easy master; nor does he seem to have
shrunk from it. But he was neither more nor less
reprehensible than the universal public sense about
him. For it must be remembered that the "spoils
system" was not then offensive to the more enlightened
citizens of New York. The system was no
excess of democracy or universal suffrage. It had
arisen amidst a suffrage for governor and senators
limited to those who held in freehold land worth at
least &pound;100, and for assemblymen limited to those
who held in freehold land worth &pound;20, or paid a
yearly rent of forty shillings, and who were rated
and actually paid taxes. It was practiced by men
of aristocratic habits chosen by the well-to-do classes.
It grew in the disputes of great family interests,
and in the bitterness of popular elements met in a
new country, still strange or even foreign to one
another, and permitted by their release from the
dangers of war and the fear of British oppression
to indulge their mutual dislikes.</p>

<p>The frequent "rotation" in office which was
soon to be pronounced a safeguard of republican
institutions, and which Jackson in December, 1829,
told Congress was a "leading principle in the Republicans'
creed," was by no means an unnatural
step towards an improvement of the civil service
of the State. Reformers of our day lay great stress
upon the fundamental rule of democratic govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>ment,
that a public office is simply a trust for the
people; and they justly find the chief argument
against the abuses of patronage in the notorious use
of office for the benefit of small portions of the people,
to the detriment of the rest. In England, however,
for centuries (and to some extent the idea
survives there in our own time), there was in an
office a quality of property having about it the
same kind of sacred immunity which belongs to
real or personal estate. There were reversions to
offices after the deaths of their occupants, like
vested remainders in lands. It was offensive to the
ordinary sense of decency and justice that the right
of a public officer to appropriate so much of the
public revenue should be attacked. It did not offend
the public conscience that great perquisites
should belong to officers performing work of the
most trifling value or none at all. The same practices
and traditions, weakened by distance from
England and by the simpler life and smaller wealth
of the colonists, came to our forefathers. They existed
when the democratic movement, stayed during
the necessities of war and civil reconstruction, returned
at the end of the last century and became
all-powerful in 1801. To break this idea of property
and right in office, to make it clear that every
office was a mere means of service of the people at
the wish of the people, there seemed, to very patriotic
and generally very wise men, no simpler way
than that the people by their elections should take
away and distribute offices in utter disregard of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
interests of those who held them. The odious result
to which this afterwards led, of making offices
the mere property of influential politicians, was but
imperfectly foreseen. Nor did that result, inevitable
as it was, follow for many years. There seems
no reason to believe that the incessant and extensive
changes in office which began in 1801, seriously
lowered the standard of actual public service
until years after Van Buren was a powerful and
conspicuous politician. Political parties were pretty
generally in the hands of honest men. The prostituted
and venal disposition of "spoils," though a
natural sequence, was to come long after. Rotation
was practiced, or its fruits were accepted and enjoyed
with satisfaction, by public men of the State
who were really statesmen, who had high standards
of public honor and duty, whose minds were directed
towards great and exalted public ends. If it seemed
right to De Witt Clinton, Edward Livingston,
Robert R. Livingston, and Ambrose Spencer, surely
lesser gods of our early political Olympus could not
be expected to refuse its advantages or murmur at
its hardships. Nor was the change distasteful to
the people, if we may judge by their political behavior.
No faction or party seems to have been
punished by public sentiment for the practice except
in conspicuous cases like those of De Witt
Clinton and Van Buren, where sometimes blows
aimed at single men roused popular and often an
undeserved sympathy. The idea that a public officer
should easily and naturally go from the ranks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of the people without special equipment, and as
easily return to those ranks, has been popularly
agreeable wherever the story of Cincinnatus has
been told. Early in this century the closeness of
offices to ordinary life, and the absence of an organized
bureaucracy controlling or patronizing the
masses of men, seemed proper elements of the great
democratic reform. There had not yet arisen the
very modern and utilitarian and the vastly better
conception of a service, the responsible directors of
whose policy should be changed with popular sentiment,
but whose subordinates should be treated by
the public as any other employer would treat them,
upon simple and unsentimental rules of business.
Another practical consideration makes more intelligible
the failure of our ancestors to perceive the
dangers of the great change they permitted. Offices
were not nearly as technical, their duties not nearly
as uniform, as they have grown to be in the more
complex procedures of our enormously richer and
more populous time. Every officer did a multitude
of things. Intelligent and active men in unofficial
life shifted with amazing readiness and success
from one calling to another. A general became a
judge, or a judge became a general,&mdash;as, indeed,
we have seen in later days. A merchant could learn
to survey; a farmer could keep or could learn to
keep fair records.</p>

<p>In the art of making of the lesser offices ammunition
with which to fight great battles over great
questions, Van Buren became a master. His im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>perturbable
temper and patience, his keen reading
of the motives and uses of men, gave him so firm
a hold upon politicians that it has been common to
forget the undoubted hold he long had upon the
people. In April, 1816, he was re&euml;lected senator
for a second term of four years. His eight years
of service in the senate expired in 1820.</p>

<p>In November, 1812, the first session of the new
legislature was held to choose presidential electors.
Not until sixteen years later were electors chosen
directly by the people. Van Buren voted for the
candidates favorable to De Witt Clinton for president
as against Madison. In the successful struggle
of the Clintonians for these electors, he is said
in this, his first session, to have shown the address
and activity which at once made him a Republican
leader. For his vote against Madison Van Buren's
friends afterwards made many apologies; his adversaries
declared it unpardonable treachery to
one of the revered Democratic fathers. But the
young politician was not open to much condemnation.
De Witt Clinton, though he had but just
reached the beginning of middle life, was a very
able and even an illustrious man. He had been
unanimously nominated in an orderly way by a
caucus of the Republican members of the legislature
of 1811 and 1812 of which Van Buren was
not a member. He had accepted the nomination
and had declined to withdraw from it. There was
a strong Republican opposition to the declaration
of war at that time, because preparation for it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
not been adequately made. Most of the Republican
members of Congress from New York had
voted against the declaration. The virtues and
abilities of Madison were not those likely to make
a successful war, as the event amply proved.
There was natural and deserved discontent with
the treatment by Jefferson's administration, in
which Madison had charge of foreign relations,
and by Madison's own administration, of the difficulties
caused by the British Orders in Council,
the Berlin and Milan decrees of Napoleon, and the
unprincipled depredations of both the great belligerents.
Van Buren is said by Butler, then an
inmate of his family, to have been an open and
decided advocate of the embargo, and of all the
strong measures proposed against Great Britain
and of the war itself. Nor was this very inconsistent
with his vote for Clinton. He had a stronger
sense of allegiance to his party in the State than
to his party at Washington; and the Republican
party of New York had regularly declared for
Clinton. For once at least Van Buren found himself
voting with the great body of the Federalists,
men who had not, like John Quincy Adams, become
reconciled to the strong and obvious, though
sometimes ineffective, patriotism of Jefferson's and
Madison's administrations. But whatever had been
the motives which induced Van Buren to support
Clinton, they soon ceased to operate. Within a
few months after this the political relations between
the two men were dissolved; and they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
politically hostile, until Clinton's death fourteen
years afterwards called from Van Buren a pathetic
tribute.</p>

<p>Although the youngest man but one, it was said,
until that time elected to the state senate, Van
Buren was in January, 1814, chosen to prepare
the answer then customarily made to the speech of
the governor. In it he defended the war, which
had been bitterly assailed in the address to the
governor made by the Federalist Assembly. Political
divisions even when carried to excess were,
he said, inseparable from the blessings of freedom;
but such divisions were unfit in their resistance of
a foreign enemy. The great body of the New York
Republicans, with Governor Tompkins at their
head, now gave Madison vigorous support; although
their defection in 1812 had probably made
possible the Federalist success at the election for
the Assembly in 1813, which embarrassed the national
administration. Van Buren warmly supported
Tompkins for his re&euml;lection in April, 1813,
and prepared for the legislative caucus a highly
declamatory, but clear and forcible, address to Republican
electors in his behalf. The provocations
to war were strongly set out. It was declared that
"war and war alone was our only refuge from
national degradation;" the "two great and crying
grievances" were "the destruction of our commerce,
and the impressment of our seamen;" for
Americans did not anticipate the surrender at
Ghent two years later to the second wrong. While<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
American sailors' "deeds of heroic valor make old
Ocean smile at the humiliations of her ancient
tyrant," the address urged Americans to mark the
man, meaning the trading Federalist, who believed
"in commuting our sailors' rights for the safety of
our merchants' goods." In the sophomoric and
solemn rhetoric of which Americans, and Englishmen
too, were then fond, it pointed out that the
favor of citizens was not sought "by the seductive
wiles and artful blandishments of the corrupt minions
of aristocracy," who of course were Federalists,
but that citizens were now addressed "in the
language which alone becomes freemen to use,&mdash;the
language to which alone it becomes freemen to
listen."</p>

<p>In the legislative sessions of 1813 and 1814 Van
Buren gave a practical and skillful support to administration
measures. But many of them were
balked by the Federalists, until in the election of
April, 1814, the rising patriotism of the country,
undaunted by the unskillful and unfortunate conduct
of the war, pronounced definitely in favor of
a strong war policy. The Republicans recovered
control of the Assembly; and there were already a
Republican governor and Senate. An extra session
was summoned in September, 1814, through which
exceedingly vigorous measures were carried against
Federalist opposition. Van Buren now definitely
led. Appropriations were made from the state
treasury for the pay of militia in the national service.
The State undertook to enlist twelve thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>sand
men for two years, a corps of sea fencibles
consisting of twenty companies, and two regiments
of colored men; slaves enlisting with the consent
of their masters to be freed. Van Buren's "classification
act" Benton afterwards declared to be the
"most energetic war measure ever adopted in this
country." By it the whole military population was
divided into 12,000 classes, each class to furnish
one able-bodied man, making the force of 12,000
to be raised. If no one volunteered from a class,
then any member of the class was authorized to
procure a soldier by a bounty, the amount of which
should be paid by the members of the class according
to their ability, to be determined by assessors.
If no soldier from the class were thus procured,
then a soldier was to be peremptorily drafted from
each class. Van Buren was proud enough of this
act to file the draft of it in his own handwriting
with the clerk of the Senate, indorsed by himself:
"The original Classification Bill, to be preserved
as a memento of the patriotism, intelligence, and
firmness of the legislature of 1814-15. M. V. B.
Albany, Feb. 15, 1815."</p>

<p>Cheered, after many disasters, by the victory at
Plattsburg and the creditable battle of Lundy's
Lane, the Senate, in Van Buren's words, congratulated
Governor Tompkins upon "the brilliant
achievements of our army and navy during the
present campaign, which have pierced the gloom
that for a time obscured our political horizon."
The end of the war left in high favor the Repub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>licans
who had supported it. The people were
good-humoredly willing to forget its many inefficiencies,
to recall complacently its few glories, and
to find little fault with a treaty which, if it established
no disputed right, at least brought peace
without surrender and without dishonor. Jackson's
fine victory at New Orleans after the treaty
was signed, though it came too late to strengthen
John Quincy Adams's dauntless front in the peace
conference, was quickly seized by the people as the
summing up of American and British prowess.
The Republicans now had a hero in the West, as
well as a philosopher at Monticello. Van Buren
drafted the resolution giving the thanks of New
York "to Major-General Jackson, his gallant officers
and troops, for their wonderful and heroic
victory."</p>

<p>In the method then well established the Republicans
celebrated their political success in 1814.
Among the removals, Abraham Van Vechten lost
the post of attorney-general, which on February
17, 1815, was conferred upon Van Buren for his
brilliant and successful leadership in the Senate.
He remained, however, a senator of the State. At
thirty-two, therefore, he was, next to the governor,
the leader of the Tompkins Republicans, now so
completely dominant; he held two political offices
of dignity and importance; and he was conducting
besides an active law practice.</p>

<p>De Witt Clinton, after his defeat for the presidency,
suffered other disasters. It was in January,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
1813, that he and Van Buren broke their political
relations; and the Republicans very largely fell off
from him. The reasons for this do not clearly
appear; but were probably Clinton's continuance
of hostility to the national administration, which
seemed unpatriotic to the Republicans, and some
of the mysterious matters of patronage in which
Clinton had been long and highly proscriptive.
In 1815 the latter was removed from the mayoralty
of New York by the influence of Governor Tompkins
in the council. He had been both mayor and
senator for several years prior to 1812. He was
mayor and lieutenant-governor when he was a candidate
for the presidency.</p>

<p>In 1816 the Republicans in the Assembly, then
closely divided between them and the Federalists
(who seemed to be favored by the apportionment),
sought one of those immoral advantages whose
wrong in times of high party feeling seems invisible
to men otherwise honorable. In the town of Pennington
a Federalist, Henry Fellows, had been
fairly elected to the Assembly by a majority of 30;
but 49 of his ballots were returned as reading
"Hen. Fellows;" and his Republican competitor,
Peter Allen, got the certificate of appointment.
The Republicans, acting, it seems, in open conference
with Van Buren, insisted not only upon
organizing the house, which was perhaps right, but
upon what was wrong and far more important.
They elected the council of appointment before
Fellows was seated, as he afterwards was by an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
almost unanimous vote. The "Peter Allen legislature"
is said to have become a term of reproach.
But, as with electoral abuses in later days, the
Federalists were not as much aided as they ought
to have been by this sharp practice of their rivals;
the people perhaps thought that, as they were in
the minority everywhere but in the Assembly, they
ought not to have been permitted, by a capture of
the council, to remove the Republicans in office.</p>

<p>At any rate the election in April, 1816, while
the "Peter Allen legislature" was still in office,
went heavily in favor of the Republicans, Van
Buren receiving his second election to the Senate.
On March 4, 1816, he was chosen by the legislature
a regent of the University of the State of New
York, an office which he held until 1829. The
University was then, as now, almost a myth, being
supposed to be the associated colleges and academies
of the State. But the regents have had a
varying charge of educational matters.</p>

<p>In 1817 the agitation, so superbly and with such
foresight conducted by De Witt Clinton, resulted
in the passage of the law under which the construction
of the Erie Canal began. Van Buren's
enmity to Clinton did not cause him to oppose
the measure, of which Hammond says he was an
"early friend." With a few others he left his
party ranks to vote with Clinton's friends; and
this necessary accession from the "Bucktails" is
said by the same fair historian to have been produced
by Van Buren's "efficient and able efforts."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
In his speech favoring it he declared that his vote
for the law would be "the most important vote he
ever gave in his life;" that "the project, if executed,
would raise the State to the highest possible
pitch of fame and grandeur," an expression not
discredited by the splendid and fruitful result of
the enterprise. Clinton, after hearing the speech,
forgot for a moment their political collisions, and
personally thanked Van Buren.</p>

<p>In April, 1817, Clinton was elected governor by
a practically unanimous vote. His resolute courage
and the prestige of the canal policy compelled
this tribute from the Republicans, in spite of his
sacrilegious presidential aspiration in 1812, and
his dismissal from the mayoralty of New York in
1815. Governor Tompkins, now vice-president,
was Clinton's only peer in New York politics.
The popular tide was too strong for the efforts of
Tompkins, Van Buren, and their associates. In
the eagerness to defeat Clinton, it was even suggested
that Tompkins should serve both as governor
and vice-president; should be at once ruler
at Albany and vice-ruler at Washington. Van
Buren did not, however, go with the hot-heads of
the legislature in opposing a bill for an election to
fill the vacancy left by the resignation, which it
was at last thought necessary for Tompkins to
make, of the governorship. No one dared run
against Clinton; and he triumphantly returned to
political power. Under this administration of his,
the party feud took definite form. Clinton's Re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>publican
adversaries were dubbed "Bucktails"
from the ornaments worn on ceremonial occasions
by the Tammany men who had long been Clinton's
enemies. The Bucktails and their successors were
the "regular" Republicans, or the Democrats as
they were later called; and they kept their regularity
until, long afterwards, the younger and
greater Bucktail leader, when venerable and laden
with honors, became the titular head of the Barnburner
defection. The merits of the feud between
Bucktails and Clintonians it is now difficult to
find. Each accused the other of coquetting with
the Federalists; and the accusation was nearly
always true of one or the other of them. Politics
was a highly developed and extremely interesting
game, whose players, though really able and patriotic
men, were apparently careless of the undignified
parts they were playing. Nor are Clintonians
and Bucktails alone in political history. Cabinets
of the greatest nations have, in more modern times,
broken on grounds as sheerly personal as those
which divided Clinton and Van Buren in 1818.
British and French ministries, as recent memoirs
and even recent events have shown, have fallen to
pieces in feuds of as little essential dignity as belonged
to those of New York seventy years ago.</p>

<p>In 1819 the Bucktails suffered the fate of war;
and Van Buren, their efficient head, was removed
from the attorney-general's office. Thurlow Weed,
then a country editor, grotesquely wrote at the
time that "rotation in office is the most striking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and brilliant feature of excellence in our benign
form of government; and that by this doctrine,
bottomed, as it is, upon the Magna Charta of our
liberties, Van Buren's removal was not only sanctioned,
but was absolutely required." The latter
still remained state senator, and soon waged a
short and decisive campaign to recover political
mastery. He now came to the aid of Governor
Tompkins, who during the war with England had
borrowed money for public use upon his personal
responsibility, and in the disbursement of several
millions of dollars for war purposes had, through
carelessness in bookkeeping or clerical detail, apparently
become a debtor of the State. The comptroller,
in spite of a law passed in 1819 to indemnify
Tompkins for his patriotic services, took a
hostile attitude which threatened the latter with
pecuniary destruction. In March, 1820, Van
Buren threw himself into the contest with a skill
and generous fervor which saved the ex-governor.
Van Buren's speech of two days for the old chief
of the Bucktails, is described by Hammond, a
political historian of New York not unduly friendly
to Van Buren, to have been "ingenious, able, and
eloquent."</p>

<p>It was also in 1820 that Van Buren promoted
the re&euml;lection of Rufus King, the distinguished
Federalist, to the United States Senate. His motives
in doing this were long bitterly assailed; but
as the choice was intrinsically admirable, Van
Buren was probably glad to gratify a patriotic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
impulse which was not very inconsistent with party
advantage. In 1819 the Republican caucus, the
last at which the Bucktails and Clintonians both
attended, was broken up amid mutual recriminations.
John C. Spencer, the son of Ambrose
Spencer, and afterwards a distinguished Whig, was
the Clintonian candidate, and had the greater
number of Republican votes. In the legislature
there was no choice, Rufus King having fewer
votes than either of the Republicans. When the
legislature of 1820 met, there appeared a pamphlet
skillfully written in a tone of exalted patriotism.
This decided the election for King. Van Buren
was its author, and was said to have been aided by
William L. Marcy. Both had suffered at the
hands of Clinton. However much they may have
been so influenced in secret, they gave in public
perfectly sound and weighty reasons for returning
this old and distinguished statesman to the place
he had honored for many years. In 1813 King
had received the votes of a few Republicans, without
whom he would have been defeated by a Republican
competitor. The Clintonians and their
adversaries had since disputed which of them had
then been guilty of party disloyalty. But it can
hardly be doubted that King's high character and
great ability, with the revolutionary glamour about
him, made his choice seem patriotic and popular,
and therefore politically prudent.</p>

<p>Van Buren's pamphlet of 1820 was addressed
to the Republican members of the legislature by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
"fellow-member" who told them that he knew and
was personally known to most of them, and that
he had, "from his infancy, taken a deep interest
in the honor and prosperity of the party." This
anonymous "fellow-member" pronounced the support
of King by Republicans to "be an act honorable
to themselves, advantageous to the country,
and just to him." He declared that the only reluctance
Republicans had to a public avowal of
their sentiments arose from a "commendable apprehension
that their determination to support him
under existing circumstances might subject them
to the suspicion of having become a party to a
political bargain, to one of those sinister commutations
of principle for power, which they think
common with their adversaries, and against which
they have remonstrated with becoming spirit." He
showed that there were degrees even among Federalists;
that some in the war had been influenced
by "most envenomed malignity against the administration
of their own government;" that a second
and "very numerous and respectable portion" had
been those "who, inured to opposition and heated
by collision, were poorly qualified to judge dispassionately
of the measures of government," who
thought the war impolitic at the time, but who
were ignorantly but honestly mistaken; but that a
third class of them had risen "superior to the prejudices
and passions of those with whom they once
acted." In the last class had been Rufus King;
at home and in the Senate he had supported the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
administration; he had helped procure loans to the
State for war purposes. The address skillfully
recalled his Revolutionary services, his membership
in the convention which framed the Federal Constitution,
his appointment by Washington as minister
to the English court, and his continuance there
under Jefferson. He was declared to be opposed
to Clinton. The address concluded by reciting that
there had been in New York "exceptionable and
unprincipled political bargains and coalitions,"
which with darker offenses ought to be proved, to
vindicate the great body of citizens "from the
charge of participating in the profligacy of the few,
and to give rest to that perturbed spirit which now
haunts the scenes of former moral and political
debaucheries;" but added that the nature of a vote
for King precluded such suspicions.</p>

<p>The last statement was just. King's return was
free from other suspicion than that he probably
preferred the Van Buren to the Clinton Republicans.
Van Buren, seeing that the Federalist
party was at an end, was glad both to do a public
service and to ally with his party, in the divisions
of the future, some part of the element so finely
represented by Rufus King. In private Van Buren
urged the support of King even more emphatically.
"We are committed," he wrote, "to his support.
It is both wise and honest, and we must have no
fluttering in our course. Mr. King's views towards
us are honorable and correct.... Let us not,
then, have any halting. I will put my head on its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
propriety." Van Buren's partisanship always had
a mellow character. He practiced the golden rule
of successful politics, to foresee future benefits
rather than remember past injuries. Indeed, it is
just to say more. In sending King to the Senate
he doubtless experienced the lofty pleasure which
a politician of public spirit feels in his occasional
ability to use his power to reach a beneficent end,
which without the power he could not have reached,&mdash;a
stroke which to a petty politician would seem
dangerous, but which the greater man accomplishes
without injury to his party standing. A year or
two after King's election, when Van Buren joined
him at Washington, there were established the
most agreeable relations between them. The refinement
and natural decorum of the younger man
easily fell in with the polished and courtly manner
of the old Federalist. Benton, who had then just
entered the Senate, said it was delightful to behold
the deferential regard which Van Buren paid to his
venerable colleague, a regard always returned by
King with marked kindness and respect.</p>

<p>In this year the era of good feeling was at its
height. Monroe was re&euml;lected president by an
almost unanimous vote, with Tompkins again as
vice-president. The good feeling, however, was
among the people, and not among the politicians.
The Republican party was about to divide by reason
of the very completeness of its supremacy.
The Federalist party was extinguished and its
members scattered. The greater number of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in New York went with the Clintonian Republicans,
with whom they afterwards formed the chief
body of the Whig party. A smaller number of
them, among whom were James A. Hamilton and
John C. Hamilton, the sons of the great founder
of the Federalist party, William A. Duer, John A.
King (the son of the re&euml;lected senator), and many
others of wealth and high social position, ranged
themselves for a time in the Bucktail ranks under
Van Buren's leadership. In the slang of the day,
they were the "high-minded Federalists," because
they had declared that Clinton's supporters practiced
a personal subserviency "disgusting to high-minded
and honorable men." With this addition,
the Bucktails became the Democratic party in New
York. In April, 1820, the gubernatorial election
was between the Clintonians supporting Clinton,
and the Bucktails supporting Tompkins, the Vice-President.
Clinton's recent and really magnificent
public service made him successful at the polls, but
his party was beaten at other points.</p>

<p>Rufus King's re&euml;lection to the Senate was believed
to have some relation to the Missouri question,
then agitating the nation. In one of his letters
urging his Republican associates to support
King, Van Buren declared that the Missouri question
concealed no plot so far as King was concerned,
but that he, Van Buren, and his friends, would
"give it a true direction." King's strong opposition
to the admission of Missouri as a slave State
was, however, perfectly open. If he returned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the Senate, it was certain he would steadily vote
against any extension of slavery. Van Buren
knew all this, and doubtless meant that King was
bargaining away none of his convictions for the
senatorship. But what the "true direction" was
which was to be given the Missouri question, is
not clear. About the time of King's re&euml;lection
Van Buren joined in calling a public meeting at
Albany to protest against extending slavery beyond
the Mississippi. He was absent at the time of the
meeting, and refused the use of his name upon the
committee to send the anti-slavery resolutions to
Washington. Nor is it clear whether his absence
and refusal were significant. He certainly did not
condemn the resolutions; and in January, 1820,
he voted in the state Senate for an instruction to
the senators and representatives in Congress "to
oppose the admission, as a State in the Union, of
any territory not comprised within the original
boundary of the United States, without making
the prohibition of slavery therein an indispensable
condition of admission." This resolution undoubtedly
expressed the clear convictions of the Republicans
in New York, whether on Van Buren's or
Clinton's side, as well as of the remaining Federalists.</p>

<p>Van Buren's direct interest in national politics
had already begun. In 1816 he was present in
Washington (then a pretty serious journey from
Albany) when the Republican congressional caucus
was held to nominate a president. Governor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Tompkins, after a brief canvass, retired; and Crawford,
then secretary of war, became the candidate
against Monroe, and was supported by most of the
Republicans from New York. Van Buren's preference
was not certainly known, though it is supposed
he preferred Monroe. In 1820 he was
chosen a presidential elector in place of an absentee
from the electoral college, and participated in
the all but unanimous vote for Monroe. He voted
with the other New York electors for Tompkins
for the vice-presidency. In April, 1820, he wrote
to Henry Meigs, a Bucktail congressman then at
Washington, that the rascality of some of the deputy
postmasters in the State was intolerable, and
cried aloud for relief; that it was impossible to
penetrate the interior of the State with friendly
papers; and that two or three prompt removals
were necessary. The postmaster-general was to be
asked "to do an act of justice and render us a partial
service" by the removal of the postmasters
at Bath, Little Falls, and Oxford, and to appoint
successors whom Van Buren named. In January,
1821, Governor Clinton sent this letter to the legislature,
with a message and other papers so numerous
as to be carried in a green bag, which gave
the name to the message, in support of a charge
that the national administration had interfered in
the state election. But the "green-bag message"
did Van Buren little harm, for Clinton's own proscriptive
rigor had been great, and it was only
two years before that Van Buren himself had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
removed from the attorney-generalship. In 1821
the political division of the New York Republicans
was carried to national politics. When a speaker
was to be chosen in place of Clay, Taylor of New
York, the Republican candidate, was opposed by
the Bucktail congressmen, because he had supported
Clinton.</p>

<p>In February, 1821, Van Buren gained the then
dignified promotion to the federal Senate. He was
elected by the Bucktails against Nathan Sanford,
the sitting senator, who was supported by the Clintonians
and Federalists. Van Buren was now
thirty-eight years old, and in the early prime of his
powers. He had run the gauntlet of two popular
elections; he had been easily first among the Republicans
of the state Senate; he had there shown
extraordinary political skill and an intelligent and
public spirit; he had ably administered the chief
law office of the State which was not judicial.
Though not yet keenly interested in any federal
question,&mdash;for his activity and thought had been
sufficiently engaged in affairs of his own State,&mdash;he
turned to the new field with an easy confidence,
amply justified by his mastery of the problems with
which he had so far grappled. He reached Washington
the undoubted leader of his party in the
State. The prestige of Governor Tompkins, although
just re&euml;lected vice-president, had suffered
from his recent defeat for the governorship, and
from his pecuniary and other difficulties; and besides,
he obviously had not Van Buren's unrivaled
equipment for political leadership.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Van Buren attended his first session in
the federal capital he performed for the public
most honorable service in the state constitutional
convention which sat in the autumn of 1821. This
body illustrated the earnest and wholesome temper
in which the most powerful public men of the
State, after many exhibitions of partisan, personal,
and even petty animosities, could treat so serious
and abiding a matter as its fundamental law. The
Democrats sent Vice-President Tompkins, both the
United States senators, King and Van Buren, the
late senator, Sanford, and Samuel Nelson, then
beginning a long and honorable career. The Clintonians
and Federalists sent Chancellor Kent and
Ambrose Spencer, the chief justice. Van Buren
was chosen from Otsego, and not from his own
county, probably because the latter was politically
unfavorable to him.</p>

<p>This convention was one of the steps in the
democratic march. It was called to broaden the
suffrage, to break up the central source of patronage
at Albany, and to enlarge local self-administration.
The government of New York had so far
been a freeholders' government, with those great
virtues, and those greater and more enduring vices,
which were characteristic of a government controlled
exclusively by the owners of land. The
painful apprehension aroused by the democratic
resolution to reduce, if not altogether to destroy,
the exclusive privileges of land-owners, was expressed
in the convention by Chancellor Kent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
He would not "bow before the idol of universal
suffrage;" this extreme democratic principle, he
said, had "been regarded with terror by the wise
men of every age;" wherever tried, it had brought
"corruption, injustice, violence, and tyranny;" if
adopted, posterity would "deplore in sackcloth and
ashes the delusion of the day." He wished no
laws to pass without the free consent of the owners
of the soil. He did not foresee English parliaments
elected in 1885 and 1886 by a suffrage not
very far from universal, or a royal jubilee celebrated
by democratic masses, or the prudent conservatism
in matters of property of the enfranchised
French democracy,&mdash;he foresaw none of
these when he declared that England and France
could not sustain the weight of universal suffrage;
that "the radicals of England, with the force of
that mighty engine, would at once sweep away the
property, the laws, and the liberty of that island
like a deluge." Van Buren distinguished himself
in the debate. Upon this exciting and paramount
topic he did not share the temper which possessed
most of his party. His speech was clear, explicit,
philosophical, and really statesmanlike. It so impressed
even his adversaries; and Hammond, one
of them, declared that he ought for it to be ranked
"among the most shining orators and able statesmen
of the age."</p>

<p>In reading this, or indeed any of the utterances
of Van Buren where the occasion required distinctness,
it is difficult to find the ground of the charge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of "noncommittalism" so incessantly made against
him. He doubtless refrained from taking sides on
questions not yet ripe for decision, however clear,
and whatever may have been his speculative opinions.
But this is the duty of every statesman; it
has been the practice of every politician who has
promoted reform. Van Buren now pointed out
how completely the events of the forty years past
had discredited the grave speculative fears of
Franklin, Hamilton, and Madison as to the result
of some provisions of the Federal Constitution.
With Burke he believed experience to be the only
unerring touchstone. He conclusively showed that
property had been as safe in those American communities
which had universal suffrage as in the
few which retained a property qualification; that
venality in voting, apprehended from the change,
already existed in the grossest forms at the parliamentary
elections of England. Going to the truth
which is at the dynamic source of democratic institutions,
he told the chancellor that when among
the masses of America the principles of order and
good government should yield to principles of anarchy
and violence and permit attacks on private
property or an agrarian law, all constitutional provisions
would be idle and unavailing, because they
would have lost all their force and influence.
With a true instinct, however, Van Buren wished
the steps to be taken gradually. He was not yet
ready, he said, to admit to the suffrage the shifting
population of cities, held to the government by no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
other ties than the mere right to vote. He was
not ready for a really universal suffrage. The
voter ought, if he did not participate in the government
by paying taxes or performing militia
duty, to be a man who was a householder with
some of the elements of stability, with something
at stake in the community. Although they had
reached "the verge of universal suffrage," he
could not with his Democratic friends take the
"one step beyond;" he would not cheapen the invaluable
right by conferring it with indiscriminating
hand "on every one, black or white, who
would be kind enough to condescend to accept it."
Though a Democrat he was opposed, he said, to
a "precipitate and unexpected prostration of all
qualifications;" he looked with dread upon increasing
the voters in New York city from thirteen
or fourteen thousand to twenty-five thousand, believing
(curious prediction for a father of the
Democratic party!) that the increase "would render
their elections rather a curse than a blessing,"
and "would drive from the polls all sober-minded
people."</p>

<p>The universal suffrage then postponed was wisely
adopted a few years later. Democracy marched
steadily on; and Van Buren was willing, probably
very willing, to be guided by experience. He
opposed in the convention a proposal supported
by most of his party to restrict suffrage to white
citizens, but favored a property qualification for
black men, the $250 freehold ownership until then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
required of white voters. He would not, he said,
draw from them a revenue and yet deny them the
right of suffrage. Twenty-five years later, in 1846,
nearly three-fourths of the voters of the State refused
equal suffrage to the blacks; and even in
1869, six years after the emancipation proclamation,
a majority still refused to give them the same
rights as white men.</p>

<p>The question of appointments to office was the
chief topic in the convention. Van Buren, as
chairman of the committee on this subject, made
an interesting and able report. It was unanimously
agreed that the use of patronage by the
council of appointment had been a scandal. Only
a few members voted to retain the council, even if
it were to be elected by the people. He recommended
that military officers, except the highest,
be elected by the privates and officers of militia.
Of the 6663 civil officers whose appointment and
removal by the council had for twenty years kept
the State in turmoil, he recommended that 3643,
being notaries, commissioners, masters and examiners
in chancery, and other lesser officers, should
be appointed under general laws to be enacted by
the legislature; the clerks of courts and district
attorneys should be appointed by the common pleas
courts; mayors and clerks of cities should be appointed
by their common councils, except in New
York, where for years afterwards the mayors were
appointed; the heads of the state departments
should be appointed by the legislature; and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
other officers, including surrogates and justices of
the peace as well as the greater judicial officers,
should be appointed by the governor upon the
confirmation of the Senate. Van Buren declared
himself opposed, here again separating himself
from many of his party associates, to the popular
election of any judicial officers, even the justices
of the peace. Of all this he was long after to be
reminded as proof of his aristocratic contempt for
democracy. His recommendations were adopted
in the main; although county clerks and sheriffs,
whom he would have kept appointive, were made
elective. Upon this question he was in a small
minority with Chancellor Kent and Rufus King,
having most of his party friends against him.
Thus was broken up the enormous political power
so long wielded at Albany, and the patronage distributed
through the counties. The change, it was
supposed, would end a great abuse. It did end the
concentration of patronage at the capital; but the
partisan abuses of patronage were simply transferred
to the various county seats, to exercise a
different and wider, though probably a less dangerous,
corruption.</p>

<p>The council of revision fell with hardly a friend
to speak for it. It was one of those checks upon
popular power of which Federalists had been fond.
It consisted of the governor with the chancellor
and the judges of the Supreme Court, and had a
veto power upon bills passed by the legislature.
As the chancellor and judges held office during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
good behavior until they had reached the limit
of age, the council was almost a chamber of life
peers. The exercise of its power had provoked
great animosity. The chief judicial officers of the
State, judges, and chancellors, to whom men of our
day look back with a real veneration, had been
drawn by it into a kind of political warfare, in
which few of our higher magistrates, though popularly
elected and for terms, would dare to engage.
An act had been passed by the legislature in 1814
to promote privateering; but Chancellor Kent as a
member of the council objected to it. Van Buren
maintained with him an open and heated discussion
upon the propriety of the objections,&mdash;a discussion
in which the judicial character justly enough afforded
no protection. Van Buren's feeling against
the judges who were his political adversaries was
often exhibited. He said in the convention: "I
object to the council, as being composed of the
judiciary, who are not directly responsible to the
people. I object to it because it inevitably connects
the judiciary&mdash;those who, with pure hearts
and sound heads, should preside in the sanctuaries
of justice&mdash;with the intrigues and collisions of
party strife; because it tends to make our judges
politicians, and because such has been its practical
effect." He further said that he would not join in
the rather courtly observation that the council was
abolished because of a personal regard for the
peace of its members. He would have it expressly
remembered that the council had served the ends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of faction; though he added that he should regard
the loss of Chancellor Kent from his judicial station
as a public calamity. In his general position
Van Buren was clearly right. Again and again
have theorists, supposing judges to be sanctified
and illumined by their offices, placed in their hands
political power, which had been abused, or it was
feared would be abused, by men fancied to occupy
less exalted stations. Again and again has the result
shown that judges are only men, with human
passions, prejudices, and ignorance; men who, if
vested with functions not judicial, if freed from the
checks of precedents and law and public hearings
and appellate review, fall into the same abuses and
act on the same motives, political and personal,
which belong to other men. In the council of revision
before 1821 and the electoral commission of
1877 were signally proved the wisdom of restricting
judges to the work of deciding rights between
parties judicially brought before them.</p>

<p>Van Buren's far from "non-committal" talk
about the judges was not followed by any support
of the proposal to "constitutionize" them out of
office. The animosity of a majority of the members
against the judges then in office was intense;
and they were not willing to accept the life of the
council of revision as a sufficient sacrifice. Nor
was the animosity entirely unreasonable. Butler,
in one of his early letters to Jesse Hoyt, described
the austerity with which Ambrose Spencer, the
chief justice, when the young lawyer sought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
address him, told him to wait until his seniors had
been heard. In the convention there were doubtless
many who had been offended with a certain
insolence of place which to this day characterizes
the bearing of many judges of real ability; and
the opportunity of making repayment was eagerly
seized. Nor was it unreasonable that laymen
should, from the proceedings of judges when acting
upon political matters which laymen understood
as well as they, make inferences about the fairness
of their proceedings on the bench upon which laymen
could not always safely speak. By a vote of
66 to 39, the convention refused to retain the
judges then in office,&mdash;a proceeding which, with
all the faults justly or even naturally found with
them, was a gross violation of the fundamental
rule which ought to guide civilized lands in changing
their laws. For the retention of the judges
was perfectly consistent with the judicial scheme
adopted. Van Buren put all this most admirably
before voting with the minority. He told the convention,
and doubtless truly, that from the bench
of judges, whose official fate was then at their
mercy, he had been assailed "with hostility, political,
professional, and personal,&mdash;hostility which
had been the most keen, active, and unyielding;"
but that he would not indulge individual resentment
in the prostration of his private and political
adversary. The judicial officer, who could not be
reached by impeachment or the proceeding for
removal by a two-thirds vote, ought not to be dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>turbed.
They should amend the constitution, he
told the convention, upon general principles, and
not descend to pull down obnoxious officers. He
begged it not to ruin its character and credit by
proceeding to such extremities. But the removal
of the judges did not prove unpopular. Only
eight members of the convention voted against the
Constitution; only fifteen others did not sign it.
And the freeholders of the State, while deliberately
surrendering some of their exclusive privileges,
adopted it by a vote of 75,422 to 41,497.</p>

<p>Van Buren's service in this convention was that
of a firm, sensible, far-seeing man, resolute to make
democratic progress, but unwilling, without further
light from experience, to take extreme steps
difficult to retrace. With a strong inclination towards
great enlargement of the suffrage, he pointed
out that a mistake in going too far could never be
righted "except by the sword." The wisdom of
enduring temporary difficulties, rather than to
make theoretical changes greater than were necessary
to obviate serious and great wrongs, was common
to him with the highest and most influential
type of modern law-makers. With some men of
the first rank, the convention had in it very many
others crudely equipped for its work; and it met
in an atmosphere of personal and political asperity
unfavorable to deliberations over organic law.
Van Buren was politically its most powerful member.
It is clear that his always conservative temper,
aided by his tact and by his temperate and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
persuasive eloquence, held back his Democratic
associates, headed by the impetuous and angered
General Root, from changes far more radical than
those which were made. Though eminent as a
party man, he showed on this conspicuous field
undoubted courage and independence and high
sense of duty. Entering national politics he was
fortunate therefore to be known, not only as a
skillful and adroit and even managing politician,
as a vigorous and clear debater, as a successful
leader in popular movements, but also as a man of
firm and upright patriotism, with a ripe and educated
sense of the complexity of popular government,
and a sober appreciation of the kind of
dangers so subtly mingled with the blessings of
democracy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="ft80">UNITED STATES SENATOR.&mdash;RE&Euml;STABLISHMENT
OF PARTIES.&mdash;PARTY LEADERSHIP</span></h2>


<p>In December, 1821, Van Buren took his seat in
the United States Senate. The "era of good feeling"
was then at its height. It was with perfect
sincerity that Monroe in his message of the preceding
year had said: "I see much cause to rejoice in
the felicity of our situation." He had just been
re&euml;lected president with but a single vote against
him. The country was in profound peace. The
burdens of the war with England were no longer
felt; and its few victories were remembered with
exuberant good-nature. Two years before, Florida
had been acquired by the strong and persisting
hand of the younger Adams. Wealth and comfort
were in rapid increase. The moans and rage of the
defeated and disgraced Federalists were suppressed,
or, if now and then feebly heard, were complacently
treated as outbursts of senility and impotence.
People were not only well-to-do in fact, but, what
was far more extraordinary, they believed themselves
to be so. In his great tariff speech but three
or four years later, Hayne called it the "period of
general jubilee." Every great public paper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
speech, described the "felicity" of America. The
president pointed out to his fellow-citizens "the
prosperous and happy condition of our country in
all the great circumstances which constitute the
felicity of a nation;" he told them that they were
"a free, virtuous, and enlightened people;" the
unanimity of public sentiment in favor of his
"humble pretensions" indicated, he thought, "the
great strength and stability of our Union." And
all was reciprocated by the people. This modest,
gentle ruler was in his very mediocrity agreeable
to them. He symbolized the comfort and order, the
supreme respectability of which they were proud.
When in 1817 he made a tour through New England,
which had seen neither Jefferson nor Madison
as visitors during their terms of office, and in his
military coat of domestic manufacture, his light
small-clothes and cocked hat, met processions and
orators without end, it was obvious that this was
not the radical minister whom Washington had recalled
from Jacobin Paris for effusively pledging
eternal friendship and submitting to fraternal embraces
in the National Convention. Such youthful
frenzy was now long past. America was enjoying
a great national idyl. Even the Federalists, except
of course those who had been too violent or who
were still unrepentant, were not utterly shut out
from the light of the placid high noon. Jackson
had urged Monroe in 1816 "to exterminate that
monster called party spirit," and to let some Federalists
come to the board. Monroe thought, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>ever,
"that the administration should rest strongly
on the Republican party," though meaning to bring
all citizens "into the Republican fold as quietly as
possible." Party, he declared, was unnecessary to
free government; all should be Republicans. And
when Van Buren reached the sprawling, slatternly
American capital in 1821, all were Republicans.</p>

<p>There were of course personal feuds in this great
political family. Those of New York were the
most notorious; but there were many others. But
such rivalries and quarrels were only a proof of the
political calm. When families are smugly prosperous
they indulge petty dislikes, which disappear
before storm or tragedy. The halcyon days could
not last. Monroe's dream of a country with but
one party, and that basking in perpetual "felicity,"
was, in spite of what seemed for the moment a close
realization, as far from the truth as the dreams of
later reformers who would in politics organize all
the honest, respectable folk together against all the
dishonest.</p>

<p>The heat of the Missouri question was ended at
the session before Van Buren's senatorial term began.
It seemed only a thunder-storm passing across
a rich, warm day in harvest time, angry and agitating
for the moment, but quickly forgotten by
dwellers in the pastoral scene when the rainbow of
compromise appeared in the delightful hues of
Henry Clay's eloquence. The elements of the tremendous
struggle yet to come were in the atmosphere,
but they were not visible. The slavery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
question had no political importance to Van Buren
until fourteen years afterwards. In judging the
men of that day we shall seriously mistake if we
set up our own standards among their ideas. The
moral growth in the twenty-five years since the
emancipation makes it irksome to be fair to the
views of the past generation, or indeed to the former
views of half of our present generation. Slavery
has come to seem intrinsically wicked, hideous, to
be hated everywhere. But sixty-five years ago it
still lingered in several of the Northern States. It
was wrong indeed; but the temper of condemnation
towards it was Platonic, full of the unavailing and
unpoignant regret with which men hear of poverty
and starvation and disease and crime which they
do not see and which they cannot help. Nor did
slavery then seem to the best of men so very great
a wrong even to the blacks; there were, it was
thought, many ameliorations and compensations.
Men were glad to believe and did believe that the
human chattels were better and happier than they
would have been in Africa. The economic waste
of slavery, its corrupting and enervating effect upon
the whites, were thought to be objections quite as
serious. Besides, it was widely fancied to be at
worst but a temporary evil. Jefferson's dislike of
it was shared by many throughout the South as well
as the North. The advantages of a free soil were
becoming so apparent in the strides by which the
North was passing the South in every material advantage,
that the latter, it seemed, must surely learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the lesson. For the institution within States already
admitted to the Union, anti-slavery men felt no responsibility.
Forty years later the great leader of
the modern Republican party would not, he solemnly
declared in the very midst of a pro-slavery
rebellion, interfere with slavery in the States if the
Union could be saved without disturbing it. If men
in South Carolina cared to maintain a ruinous and
corrupting domestic institution, even if it were a
greater wrong against the slaves than it was believed
to be, or even if it were an injury to the whites
themselves, still men of Massachusetts and New
York ought, it seemed to them, to be no more disturbed
over it than we feel bound to be over polygamy
in Turkey.</p>

<p>But as to the territory west of the Mississippi
not yet formed into States, there was a different
sentiment held by a great majority at the North
and by many at the South. Slavery was not established
there. The land was national domain,
whose forms of political and social life were yet to
be set up. Why not, before the embarrassments
of slave settlement arose, devote this new land to
freedom,&mdash;not so much to freedom as that shining
goddess of mercy and right and justice who rose
clear and obvious to our purged vision out of the
civil war, as to the less noble deities of economic
well-being, thrift, and industrial comfort? Democrats
at the North, therefore, were almost unanimous
that Missouri should come in free or not at
all; and so with the rest of the territory beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the Mississippi, except the old slave settlement of
Louisiana, already admitted as a State. The resolution
in the legislature of New York in January,
1820, supported by Van Buren, that freedom be
"an indispensable condition of admission" of new
States, was but one of many exhibitions of feeling
at the North. Monroe and the very best of Americans
did not, however, think the principle so sacred
or necessary as to justify a struggle. John Quincy
Adams, hating slavery as did but few Americans,
distinctly favored the compromise by which Missouri
came in with slavery, and by which the other
new territory north of the present southern line of
Missouri extended westward was to be free, and the
territory south of it slave. With no shame he acquiesced
in the very thing about which forty years
later the nation plunged into war. "For the present,"
he wrote, "this contest is laid asleep." So
the stream of peaceful sunshine and prosperity returned
over the land.</p>

<p>Van Buren's views at this time were doubtless
clear against the extension of slavery. He disliked
the institution; and in part saw how inconsistent
were its odious practices with the best civic growth,
how debasing to whites and blacks alike. In
March, 1822, he voted in the Senate, with Harrison
Gray Otis of Massachusetts and Rufus King, for
a proviso in the bill creating the new Territory of
Florida by which the introduction of slaves was
forbidden except by citizens removing there for
actual settlement, and by which slaves introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in violation of the law were to be freed. But he
was in a minority. Northern senators from Rhode
Island, New Jersey, and Indiana refused to interfere
with free trade in slaves between the Southern
States and this southernmost territory.</p>

<p>Among the forty-eight members of the Senate
which met in December, 1821, neither Clay nor
Calhoun nor Webster had a seat. The first was
restless in one of his brief absences from official
life; the second was secretary of war; and Webster,
out of Congress, was making great law arguments
and greater orations. Benton was there
from the new State of Missouri, just beginning his
thirty years. The warm friendship and political
alliance between him and Van Buren must have
soon begun. During all or nearly all Van Buren's
senatorship the two occupied adjoining seats. Two
years later Andrew Jackson was sent to the Senate
by Tennessee, as a suitable preliminary to his presidential
canvass. During the next two sessions
Van Buren, Benton, and Jackson were thrown
together; and without doubt the foundations were
laid of their lifelong intimacy and political affection.
Benton and Jackson, personal enemies years
before, had become reconciled. Among these associates
Van Buren adhered firmly enough to his
own clear views; he did not turn obsequiously to
the rising sun of Tennessee. William H. Crawford,
the secretary of the treasury, had, in the
Republican congressional caucus of 1816, stood

reasons which neither history nor tradition seems
sufficiently to have brought us, he inspired a strong
and even enthusiastic loyalty among many of his
party. His candidacy in 1824 was more "regular"
than that of either Adams, Jackson, or Clay, whose
friends combined against him as the strongest
of them all. Though Crawford had been prostrated
by serious disease in 1823, Van Buren remained
faithful to him until, in 1825, after refusing
a seat in Adams's cabinet, he retired from national
public life a thoroughly broken man.</p>

<p>The first two sessions of Congress, after Van
Buren's service began, seemed drowsy enough.
French land-titles in Louisiana, the settlement of
the accounts of public officers, the attempt to abolish
imprisonment for debt, the appropriation for
money for diplomatic representatives to the new
South American states and their recognition,&mdash;nothing
more exciting than these arose, except
Monroe's veto, in May, 1822, of the bill authorizing
the erection of toll-gates upon the Cumberland
road and appropriating $9000 for them.
This brought distinctly before the public the great
question of internal improvements by the federal
government, which Van Buren, Benton, and Jackson
afterwards chose as one of the chief battle-grounds
for their party. For this bill Van Buren
indeed voted, while Benton afterwards boasted that
he was one of the small minority of seven who discerned
its true character. But this trifling appropriation
was declared by Barbour, who was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
charge of the measure, not to involve the general
question; it was said to be a mere incident necessary
to save from destruction a work for which
earlier statesmen were responsible. Monroe, though
declaring in his veto that the power to adopt and
execute a system of internal improvements national
in their character would have the happiest effect on
all the great interests of the Union, decided that
the Constitution gave no such power. Six years
later, in a note to his speech upon the power of the
Vice-President to call to order for words spoken in
debate in the Senate, Van Buren apologized for his
vote on the bill, because it was his first session, and
because he was sincerely desirous to aid the Western
country and had voted without full examination.
He added that if the question were again
presented to him, he should vote in the negative;
and that it had been his only vote in seven years
of service which the most fastidious critic could
torture into an inconsistency with his principles
upon internal improvements. In January, 1823,
during his second session, Van Buren spoke and
voted in favor of the bill to repair the road, but
still took no decided ground upon the general
question. He said that the large expenditure already
made on the road would have been worse
than useless if it were now suffered to decay; that
the road, being already constructed, ought to be
preserved; but whether he would vote for a new
construction he did not disclose. Even Benton,
who was proud to have been one of the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
minority against the bill of the year before for toll-gates
upon the road, was now with Van Buren,
constitutional scruples yielding to the statesmanlike
reluctance to waste an investment of millions
of dollars rather than spend a few thousands to
save it.</p>

<p>In January, 1824, Van Buren proposed to solve
these difficulties by a constitutional amendment.
Congress was to have power to make roads and
canals, but the money appropriated was to be apportioned
among the States according to population.
No road or canal was to be made within any
State without the consent of its legislature; and
the money was to be expended in each State under
the direction of its legislature. This proposal
seems to have fallen still-born and deservedly. It
illustrated Van Buren's jealousy of interference
with the rights of States. But the right of each
State to be protected, he seemed to forget, involved
its right not to be taxed for improvements in other
States which it neither controlled nor promoted.
Van Buren's speech in support of the proposal
would to-day seem very heretical to his party. A
dozen years later he himself would probably have
admitted it to be so. He then believed in the
abstract proposition that such funds of the nation
as could be raised without oppression, and as were
not necessary to the discharge of indispensable
demands upon the government, should be expended
upon internal improvements under restrictions
guarding the sovereignty and equal interests of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
States. Henry Clay would not in theory have gone
much further. But to this subject in its national
aspect Van Buren had probably given but slight
attention. The success of the Erie Canal, with
him doubtless as with others, made adverse theories
of government seem less impressive. But Van
Buren and his school quickly became doubtful and
soon hostile to the federal promotion of internal
improvements. The opposition became popular on
the broader reasoning that great expenditures for
internal improvements within the States were not
only, as the statesmen at first argued, violations
of the letter of the Constitution, whose sanctity
could, however, be saved by proper amendment,
but were intrinsically dangerous, and an unwholesome
extension of the federal power which ought
not to take place whether within the Constitution
or by amending it. Aided by Jackson's
powerful vetoes, this sentiment gained a strength
with the people which has come down to our day.
We have river and harbor bills, but they are supposed
to touch directly or indirectly our foreign
commerce, which, under the Constitution and upon
the essential theory of our confederation, is a subject
proper to the care of the Union.</p>

<p>In the same session Van Buren spoke at length
in favor of the bill to abolish imprisonment for
debt, and drew with precision the distinction wisely
established by modern jurisprudence, that the property
only, and not the body of the debtor, should
be at the mercy of his creditor, where the debt involved
no fraud or breach of trust.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The session of 1823-1824 was seriously influenced
by the coming presidential election. The
protective tariff of 1824 was christened with the
absurd name of the "American system," though it
was American in no other or better sense than foreign
war to protect fancied national rights is an
American system, and though the system had come
from the middle ages in the company of other restrictions
upon the intercourse of nations. It was
carried by the factitious help of this designation
and the fine leadership of Clay. With Jackson
and Benton, Van Buren voted for it, against men
differing as widely from each other as his associate,
the venerable Federalist Rufus King, differed from
Hayne, the brilliant orator of South Carolina.
Upon the tariff Van Buren then had views clearer,
at least, than upon internal improvements. In
1824 he was unmistakably a protectionist. The
moderation of his views and the pressure from his
own State were afterwards set up as defenses for
this early attitude of his. But he declared himself
with sufficient plainness not only to believe in the
constitutionality of a protective tariff, but that 1824
was a fit year in which to extend its protective
features. He acted, too, with the amplest light upon
the subject. The dislike of the Holy Alliance, the
hated recollections of the Orders in Council and
the Napoleonic decrees, the idea that, for self-defense
in times of war, the country must be forced
to produce many goods not already produced,&mdash;these
considerations had great weight, as very well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
appears in the speech for the bill delivered by
Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky, afterwards
Van Buren's associate on the presidential ticket.
"When the monarchs of Europe are assembled
together, do you think," he asked, "that we are
not a subject of their holy consultations?" But
the support of the bill was upon broader considerations.
The debates upon the tariff in the House
of Representatives in February, March, and April,
and in the Senate in April, 1824, were admirable
presentations of the subject. Webster in the
House and Hayne in the Senate put the free
trade side. The former, still speaking his own
sentiments, declared that "the best apology for laws
of prohibition and laws of monopoly will be found
in that state of society, not only unenlightened but
sluggish, in which they are most generally established."
But now, he said, "competition comes in
place of monopoly, and intelligence and industry
ask only for fair play and an open field." He
repudiated the principle of protection. "On the
contrary," said he, "I think freedom of trade to
be the general principle, and restriction the exception."</p>

<p>Nor was Van Buren then left without the light
which afterwards reached him on the constitutional
question. Rufus King said that, if gentlemen
wished to encourage the production of hemp and
iron, they ought to bring in a bill to give bounties
on those articles; for there was the same constitutional
right to grant bounties as to levy restrictive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
duties upon foreign products. Hayne made the
really eloquent and masterly speech for which he
ought to stand in the first rank of orators, and
which summed up as well for free-traders now as
then the most telling arguments against artificial
restrictions. He skillfully closed with Washington's
words: "Our commercial policy should hold
an equal and impartial hand, neither seeking nor
granting exclusive favors or preferences; consulting
the natural course of things; diffusing and
diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce,
but forcing nothing." Hayne did not confine
himself to the doctrines of Adam Smith, or
the hardships which protection meant to a planting
region like his own. For the chief interest of the
South was in cotton; and the price of cotton was
largely determined by the ability of foreigners to
import it from America,&mdash;an ability in its turn
dependent upon the willingness of America to take
her pay, directly or indirectly, in foreign commodities.
Hayne, however, went further. He clearly
raised the question, whether the encouragement of
manufactures could constitutionally be made a
Federal object.</p>

<p>Sitting day after day under this long debate in
the little senate chamber then in use, where men
listened to speeches, if for no other reason, because
they were easily heard, Van Buren could not, with
his ability and readiness, have misunderstood the
general principles involved. Early in the debate,
upon a motion to strike out the duty on hemp, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
briefly but explicitly said that "he was in favor of
increasing the duty on hemp, with a view of affording
protection to its cultivation in this country."
He voted against limiting the duty on wool to
twenty-five per cent., but voted against a duty of
twenty-five per cent. on India silks,&mdash;a revenue
rather than a protective duty. He voted for duties
on wheat and wheat flour and potatoes. He voted
against striking out the duty on books, in spite of
Hayne's grotesque but forcible argument that they
were to be considered "a raw material, essential to
the formation of the mind, the morals, and the
character of the people." It is difficult to understand
the significance of all Van Buren's votes on
the items of the bill; but the record shows them
to have been, on the whole, protectionist, with a
preference for moderate rates, but a firm assertion
of the wool interests of New York. Benton tells
us that Van Buren was one of the main speakers
for the bill; but the assertion is not borne out by
the record. He delivered no general speech upon
the subject, as did most of the senators, but seems
to have spoken only upon some of the details as
they were considered in committee of the whole.
The best to be said in Van Buren's behalf is, that
his judgment was not yet so ripe upon the matter
as not to be still open to great change. He was in
his third session, and still new to national politics,
and there was before him the plain and strong
argument that his State wanted protection. In
1835 Butler, speaking for him as a presidential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
candidate, said that his personal feelings had been
"at all times adverse to the high tariff policy."
But "high tariff" was then, as now, a merely relative
term. His votes placed him in that year very
near Henry Clay. That from 1824 he grew more
and more averse to the necessary details and results
of a protective policy is probably true. Nor ought
it to be, even from the standpoint of free-traders,
serious accusation that a public man varies his
political utterances upon the tariff question, if the
variation be progressive and steadily towards what
they deem a greater liberality. To Van Buren,
however, the tariff question never had a capital
importance. Even thirty-two years later, while
rehearsing from his retirement the achievements of
his party in excuse of the support he reluctantly
gave Buchanan, he did not name among its services
its insistence upon merely revenue duties,
although he had then for years been himself committed
to that doctrine.</p>

<p>Van Buren's vote for the tariff of 1824 had no
very direct relation to his political situation. His
own successor was not to be chosen for nearly three
years. Crawford, whom he supported for the presidency,
was the only one of the four candidates
opposed to the bill. Adams was consistently a
protectionist; he believed in actively promoting
the welfare of men, though chiefly if not exclusively
American men, even when they resisted their
own welfare. He, like his father, was perfectly
ready to use the power of government where it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
seemingly promised to be effective, without caring
much for economical theories or constitutional restrictions.
Jackson himself was far enough away
from the ranks of strict constructionists on the
tariff. In April, 1824, in the midst of the debate,
and while a presidential candidate, he wrote from
the Senate what free-traders, who afterwards supported
him, would have deemed the worst of heresies.
Like most candidates, ancient and modern,
he was "in favor of a judicious examination and
revision of" the tariff. He would advocate a tariff
so far as it enabled the country to provide itself
with the means of defense in war. But he would
go further. The tariff ought to "draw from agriculture
the superabundant labor, and employ it in
mechanism and manufactures;" it ought to "give
a proper distribution to our labor, to take from
agriculture in the United States 600,000 men, women,
and children." It is time, he cried, and quite
as extravagantly as Clay, that "we should become
a little more Americanized." How slight a connection
the tariff had with the election of 1824 is
further seen in the fact that Jackson, who thus
supported the bill, received the vote of several of
the States which strongly opposed the tariff.</p>

<p>In March, 1824, Van Buren urged the Senate to
act upon a constitutional amendment touching the
election of president. As the amendment could
not be adopted in time to affect the pending canvass,
there was, he said, no room for partisan feeling.
He insisted that if there were no majority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
choice by the electors, the choice should not rest
with the house of representatives voting by States,
but that the electors should be reconvened, and
themselves choose between the highest two candidates.
The debate soon became thoroughly partisan.
Rufus King, with but thinly veiled reference
to Crawford's nomination, denounced the
practice by which a caucus at Washington deprived
the constitutional electors of any free choice; members
of Congress were attending to president-making
rather than to their duties. He thought that
the course of events had "led near observers to
suspect a connection existing between a central
power of this description at the seat of the general
government and the legislatures of Georgia, North
Carolina, Virginia, and New York, and perhaps of
other States." To this it was pointed out with
much force that such a caucus had chosen Jefferson,
Madison, and Monroe without scandal or injury;
that members of Congress were distinguished
and representative persons familiar with national
affairs, who might with great advantage respectfully
suggest a course of action to their fellow-citizens.
Van Buren went keenly to the real point
of the belated objection to the system; it lay in
the particular action of the recent caucus. He did
not think it worth while to consider "those nice
distinctions which challenged respect for the proceedings
of conventions of one description and
denied it to others; or to detect those still more
subtle refinements which regarded meetings of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
same character as sometimes proper, and at others
destructive of the purity of elections and dangerous
to the liberties of the people." After much talk
about the will of the people, the Senate by a vote
of 30 to 13 postponed the consideration of the
amendments until after the election. Benton
joined Van Buren in the minority, although they
did not agree upon the form of amendment; but
Jackson, perhaps because he was a candidate, did
not vote.</p>

<p>It was highly probable that there would be embarrassment
in choosing the next president. It
was already nearly certain that neither candidate
would have a majority of the electoral votes. The
decision was then, as in our own time, supposed to
rest with New York; and naturally therefore Van
Buren's prestige was great, gained, as it had been,
in that difficult and opulent political field. His
attachment to Crawford was proof against the signs
of the latter's decaying strength. Crawford was
to him the Republican candidate regularly chosen,
and one agreeable to his party by the vigorous
democracy of his sentiments. His opposition to
Jefferson's embargo, and his vote for a renewal of
the charter of the Bank of the United States, had
been forgotten since his warm advocacy of the late
war with England. His formal claims to the nomination
were great. For he had been in the Senate
as early as 1807, and its president upon the death
of Vice-President Clinton in 1812; afterwards he
had been minister to France, and was now secretary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of the treasury. In the caucus of 1816 he had
nearly as many votes as Monroe; and those votes
were cast for him, it was said, though without
much probability, in spite of his peremptory refusal
to compete with Monroe. Moreover, Crawford had
a majesty and grace of personal appearance which,
with undoubtedly good though not great abilities,
had, apart from these details of his career, made
him conspicuous in the Republican ranks; and in
its chief service he was, after the retirement of
Monroe, the senior, except Adams, whose candidacy
was far more recent. Crawford's claim to the succession
was therefore very justifiable; he was the
most obvious, the most "regular," of the candidates.</p>

<p>It has been said that Van Buren was at first
inclined to Adams. The latter's unequaled public
experience and discipline of intellect doubtless
seemed, to Van Buren's precise and orderly mind,
eminent qualifications for the first office in the land.
Adams at this time, by a coincidence not inexplicable,
thought highly of Van Buren. He entered
in his diary a remark of his own, in February,
1825, that Van Buren was "a man of great talents
and of good principles; but he had suffered them
to be too much warped by party spirit." This
from an Adams may be taken as extreme praise.
It is pretty certain that if Van Buren had reprehensibly
shifted his position from Adams to Crawford,
we should find a record of it in the vast
treasure-house of damnations which Adams left.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Nor is there good reason to suppose that Van Buren
was influenced by the nomination which Crawford's
friends in Georgia gave him in 1824 for the
vice-presidency. This showed that New York had
already surrendered her favorite "son to the nation;"
he was now definitely to be counted a power
in national politics, where he was known as the
"Albany director." Crawford's enemies in Georgia,
the Clarkites, ridiculed this nomination with
the coarse and silly abuse which active politicians
to this day are always ready to use in their cynical
under-estimate of popular intelligence,&mdash;abuse
which they are by and by pretty sure to be glad to
forget. Van Buren was pictured as half man and
half cat, half fox and half monkey, half snake and
half mink. He was dubbed "Blue Whiskey Van"
and "Little Van." The Clarkites, being only a
minority in the Georgia Assembly, delighted to
vote for him as their standing candidate for doorkeeper
and the like humbler positions.</p>

<p>New York was greatly disturbed through 1824
over the presidency. Its politics were in the position
described by Senator Cobb, one of Crawford's
Georgia supporters. "Could we hit upon a few
great principles," he wrote home from Washington
in January, 1825, "and unite their support with
that of Crawford, we should succeed beyond
doubt." But the great principles were hard to
find. The people and the greater politicians were
therefore swayed by personal preferences, without
strong reason for either choice; and the lesser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
politicians were simply watching to see how the tide
ran. Adams was the most natural choice of the
New York Republicans. The South had had the
presidency for six terms. His early secession from
the Federalists; his aid in solidifying the Republican
sentiment at the North; his support of Jefferson
in the patriotic embargo struggle; his long,
eminent, and fruitful services; and his place of
secretary of state, from which Madison and Monroe
had in turn been promoted to the presidency,&mdash;all
these commended him to Northern Republicans
as a proper candidate.</p>

<p>De Witt Clinton admired and supported General
Jackson. In 1819 the latter had at a dinner in
Tammany Hall amazed and affronted the former's
Bucktail enemies by giving as his toast, "De Witt
Clinton, the enlightened statesman and governor
of the great and patriotic State of New York." In
January, 1824, Clinton was the victim of a political
outrage which illustrated the harsh partisanship
then ruling in New York politics, and may well
have determined the choice of president. Clinton
had retired from the governor's chair; but he still
held the honorary and unpaid office of canal commissioner,
to which he brought distinguished honor
but which brought none to him, and whose importance
he more than any other man had created.
The Crawford men in the legislature feared a combination
of the men of the new People's party
with the Clintonians on the presidential question.
Clinton seemed at the time an unpopular character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
To embarrass the People's party, Clinton's enemies
suddenly, and just before the rising of the
legislature, offered a resolution removing him from
the canal commissionership. The People's party,
it was thought, by opposing the resolution, would
incur popular dislike through their alliance with the
few and unpopular Clintonians; while by supporting
the resolution they would forfeit the support
of the latter upon which they relied. In either
case the Crawford men would apparently profit by
the trick. The People's party men, including those
favoring Adams for president, at once seized the
wrong horn of the dilemma, and voted for Clinton's
removal, which was thus carried by an almost
unanimous vote. But the people themselves were
underrated; the outrage promptly restored Clinton
to popular favor. In spite of the resistance of the
politicians, he was, in the fall of 1824, elected by
a large majority to the governor's seat, to which,
or to any great office, it had been supposed he
could never return; and this, although at the same
time and upon the same ticket one of those who
had voted for his removal was chosen lieutenant-governor.
Van Buren was no party to this removal,
although his political friends at Albany were
the first movers in the scheme. He himself was
far-sighted enough to see the probable effect of so
gross and indecent a use of political power. Nor
was he so relentless a partisan as to remember in
unfruitful vengeance Clinton's own prescriptive
conduct, or to remove the latter from an honorary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
seat which belonged to him above all other men.
By this silly blunder Clinton was again raised to
deserved power, which he held until his death.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 507px;">
<img src="images/i127.jpg" width="507" height="800" alt="De Witt Clinton" title="" />
</div>

<p>The popular outburst consequent upon Clinton's
removal in January, 1824, made it very dangerous
for the Bucktails to leave to the people in the fall
the choice of presidential electors. The rise of the
People's party for a time seriously threatened Van
Buren's influence. Until 1824 the presidential
electors of New York had been chosen by its legislature.
The opponents of Crawford and Van Buren,
fearing that the latter's superior political skill
would more easily capture the legislature in November,
1824, raised at the legislative elections of 1823
a cry against the Albany Regency, and demanded
that presidential electors should be chosen directly
by the people. The Regency, popularly believed
to have been founded by Van Buren, consisted of
a few able followers of his, residing or in office at
Albany. They were also called the "conspirators."
Chief among them were William L. Marcy, the
comptroller; Samuel A. Talcott, the attorney-general;
Benjamin F. Butler, then district attorney
of Albany county; Edwin Croswell, the state
printer; Roger Skinner, the United States district
judge; and Benjamin Knower, the state treasurer.
Later there joined the Regency, Silas
Wright, Azariah C. Flagg, Thomas W. Olcott, and
Charles E. Dudley. Its members were active,
skillful, shrewd politicians; and they were much
more. They were men of strong political convic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>tions,
holding and observing a high standard for
the public service, and of undoubted personal integrity.
In 1830 John A. Dix gave as a chief reason
for accepting office at Albany that he should
there be "one of the Regency." His son, Dr.
Morgan Dix, describes their aggressive honesty,
their refusal "to tolerate in those whom they could
control what their own fine sense of honor did not
approve;" and he quotes a remark made to him
by Thurlow Weed, their long and most formidable
enemy, "that he had never known a body of men
who possessed so much power and used it so well."
In his Memoirs, Weed describes their "great ability,
great industry, indomitable courage." Two
at least of the original members, Marcy and Butler,
afterwards justly rose to national distinction.
Even to our own day, the Albany Regency has
been a strong and generally a sagacious influence
in its party. John A. Dix, Horatio Seymour,
Dean Richmond, and Samuel J. Tilden long directed
its policy; and from the chief seat in its
councils the late secretary of the treasury, Daniel
Manning, was chosen in 1885.</p>

<p>In November, 1823, the People's party elected
only a minority of the legislature; but many of the
Democrats were committed to the support of an
electoral law, and the movement was clearly popular.
A just, though possibly an insufficient objection
to the law was its proposal of a great change
in anticipation of a particular election whose candidates
were already before the public. But there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
was no resort to frank argument. Its indirect defeat
was proposed by the Democratic managers,
and accomplished with the co&ouml;peration of many
supporters of Adams and Clay. A bill was reported
in the Assembly, where the Regency was in
a minority, giving the choice of the electors to the
people directly, but cunningly requiring a majority
instead of a plurality vote to elect. If there were
no majority, then the choice was to be left to the
legislature. The Adams and Clay men were unwilling
to let a plurality elect, lest in the uncertain
state of public feeling some other candidate might
be at the head of the poll; and they were probably
now quite as confident as the Bucktails, and with
more reason, of their strength upon joint ballot in
the legislature. Divided as the people of New
York were between the four presidential candidates,
it was well known that this device would
really give them no choice. The consideration of
the electoral law was postponed in the Senate upon
a pretense of objection to the form of the bill, and
with insincere protestations of a desire to pass it.
The outcome of all this was that in the election of
November, 1824, the Democrats were punished at
the polls both for the wanton attack on Clinton
and for their unprincipled treatment of the electoral
bill. The Regency got no more than a small
minority in the legislature; and De Witt Clinton,
as has been said, was chosen governor by a great
majority.</p>

<p>Crawford's supporters at Washington believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
that in a congressional caucus he would have a
larger vote than any other candidate. His opponents,
in the same belief, refused to join in a caucus,
in spite of the cry that their refusal was a
treason to old party usage. The Republicans at
Albany, probably upon Van Buren's advice, had
in April, 1823, declared in favor of a caucus, but
without effect. Two thirds of Congress would not
assent. At last, in February, 1824, a caucus was
called, doubtless in the hope that many who had refused
their assent would, finding the caucus inevitable,
attend through force of party habit. But of
the 261 members of Congress, only 66 attended;
and they were chiefly from New York, Virginia,
North Carolina and Georgia. In the caucus 62
voted for Crawford for president and 57 for Albert
Gallatin for vice-president. A cry was soon
raised against the latter as a foreigner; so that in
spite of his American residence of forty-five years,
and his invaluable services to the country and to
the Republican party through nearly all this period,
he felt compelled to withdraw.</p>

<p>The failure of the caucus almost destroyed Crawford's
chances, though Van Buren steadily kept up
courage. A few days later he wrote a confidential
letter complaining of the subserviency and ingratitude
of the non-attendants, who had "partaken
largely of the favor of the party;" but despondency,
he said, was a weakness with which he was
but little annoyed, and if New York should be
firm and promptly explicit, the election would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
substantially settled. But New York was neither
firm nor promptly explicit. Its electoral vote was
in doubt until the meeting of the legislature in
November. The Adams and Clay forces then
united, securing 31 out of the 36 electors, although
one of the 31 seems finally to have voted for Jackson.
Five Crawford electors were chosen with the
help of the Adams men, who wished to keep Clay
at the foot of the poll of presidential electors, and
thus prevent his eligibility as one of the highest
three in the House of Representatives. This device
of the Adams men may have deprived Clay of
the presidency. Thus Van Buren's New York
campaign met defeat even in the legislature, where
his friends had incurred odium rather than surrender
the choice of electors to the people, while
his forces were being thoroughly beaten by the
people at the polls. In the electoral college Crawford
received only 41 votes; Adams had 84 and
Jackson 99; while Clay with only 37 was fourth in
the race, and could not therefore enter the contest
in the House. Georgia cast 9 electoral votes for
Van Buren as vice-president.</p>

<p>Van Buren did not figure in the choice of Adams
in the House by the coalition of Adams and Clay
forces. Nor does his name appear in the traditions
of the man&#339;uvering at Washington in the winter
of 1824-25, except in a vague and improbable
story that he wished, by dividing the New York
delegation in the House on the first vote by States,
to prevent a choice, and then to throw the votes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the Crawford members for Adams, and thus secure
the glory and political profit of apparently electing
him. He did not join in the cry that Adams's
election over Jackson was a violation of the democratic
principle. Nor was it a violation of that
principle. Jackson had but a minority of the popular
vote. Clay was in political principles and
habits nearer to Adams than Jackson. It was
clearly Clay's duty to take his strength to the candidate
whose administration was most likely to be
agreeable to those opinions of his own which had
made him a candidate. The coalition was perfectly
natural and legitimate; and it was wholesome
in its consequences. It established the Whig
party; it at least helped to establish the modern
Democratic party. That the acceptance of office
by Clay would injure him was probable enough.
Coalitions have always been unpopular in America
and England, when there has seemed to follow a
division of offices. They offend the strong belief
in party government which lies deep in the political
conscience of the two countries.</p>

<p>In the congressional session of 1824-25 president-making
in the House stood in the way of
everything else of importance. Van Buren, with
increasing experience, was taking a greater and
greater part in congressional work. He joined far
more frequently in the debates. Again he spoke
for the abolition of imprisonment for debt, his colleague,
Rufus King, differing from him on this as
he now seemed to differ from him on most disputed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
questions. King had not been re&euml;lected senator,
having declined to be a candidate, because, as he
said, of his advancing years. But doubtless Van
Buren was correct in telling John Quincy Adams,
and the latter was correct in believing, as his diary
records, that King could not have been re-chosen.</p>

<p>At this session Van Buren took definite stand
against the schemes of internal improvement. On
February 11, 1825, differing even from Benton, he
voted against topographical surveys in anticipation
of public works by the Federal government. On
February 23 he voted against an appropriation of
$150,000 to extend the Cumberland road, while
Jackson and Benton both voted for it. So, also,
the next day, when Jackson voted for federal subscriptions
to help construct the Delaware and Chesapeake
Canal and the Dismal Swamp Canal, Van
Buren was against him. Two days before the
session closed he voted against the bill for the
occupation of Oregon, Benton and Jackson voting
in the affirmative. Van Buren was one of the senatorial
committee to receive the new president upon
his inauguration. It was doubtless with the easy
courtesy which was genuine with him that he welcomed
John Quincy Adams to the political battle
so disastrous to the latter.</p>

<p>When Congress met again, in December, 1825,
Van Buren took a more important place than ever
before in national politics. He now became a true
parliamentary leader; for he, like Clay, had the
really parliamentary career which has rarely been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
seen in this country. Dealing with amorphous political
elements, Van Buren created out of them a
party to promote his policy, and seized upon the
vigor and popular strength of Jackson to lead both
party and policy to supreme power. While, before
1825, Van Buren had not represented in the Senate
a party distinctly constituted, from 1825 to 1828
he definitely led the formation of the modern Democratic
party. In this work he was clearly chief.
From the floor of the Senate he addressed those of
its members inclined to his creed, and the sympathetic
elements throughout the country, and firmly
guided and disciplined them after that fashion
which in very modern days is best familiar to us
in the parliamentary conflicts of Great Britain.
Since Van Buren wielded this organizing power,
there has been in America no equally authoritative
and decisive leadership from the Senate; although
he has since been surpassed there, not only as
an orator, but in other kinds of senatorial work.
Seward seemed to exercise a like leadership in the
six years or more preceding Lincoln's election; but
he was far more the creature of the stupendous
movement of the time than he was its creator. So,
in the two years before General Grant's renomination
in 1872, Charles Sumner and Carl Schurz,
speaking from the Senate, created a new party sentiment;
but the sentiment died in a "midsummer
madness" but for which our later political history
might have been materially different. In the interesting
and fruitful three years of Van Buren's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
senatorial opposition, he showed the same qualities
of firmness, supple tact, and distinct political aims
which had given him his power in New York; but
all now upon a higher plane.</p>

<p>In December, 1825, Jackson was no longer in
the Senate. His Tennessee friends had placed him
there as in a fitting vestibule to the White House;
but it seemed as hard then as it has been since, to
go from the Senate over the apparently broad and
easy mile to the west on Pennsylvania Avenue.
So Jackson returned to the Hermitage, to await,
in the favorite American character of Cincinnatus,
the popular summons which he believed to be only
delayed. Van Buren, now thoroughly acquainted
with the general, saw in him the strongest titular
leader of the opposition. It is pretty certain, however,
that Van Buren's preference was recent. The
"Albany Argus," a Van Buren paper, had but
lately declared that "Jackson has not a single feeling
in common with the Republican party, and
makes the merit of desiring the total extinction
of it;" while Jackson papers had ridiculed Crawford's</p>

<p class="poem">
"Shallow knaves with forms to mock us,<br />
Straggling, one by one, to caucus."<br />
</p>

<p>It has been the tradition, carefully and doubtless
sincerely begun by John Quincy Adams, and
adopted by most writers dealing with this period,
that Adams met his first Congress in a spirit which
should have commanded universal support; and
that it was a factious opposition, cunningly led by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Van Buren, which thwarted his patriotic purposes.
But this is an untrue account of the second great
party division in the United States. The younger
Adams succeeded to an administration which had
represented no party, or rather which had represented
a party now become so dominant as to practically
include the whole country. As president
he found himself able to promote opinions with a
weighty authority which he had not enjoyed while
secretary of state in an era of good feeling, and
under a president who was firm, even if gentle.
Nor was it likely that Adams, with his unrivaled
experience, his resolute self-reliance, and his aggressively
patriotic feeling, would fail to impress
his own views upon the public service, lest he might
disturb a supposititious unanimity of sentiment.
His first message boldly sounded the notes of party
division. The second war with England was well
out of the public mind; and his old Federalist
associations, his belief in a strong, active, beneficent
federal government, his traditional dislike of what
seemed to him extreme democratic tendencies and
constitutional refinings away of necessary federal
power,&mdash;all these made him promptly and ably
take an attitude very different from that of his
predecessors. The compliment was perfectly sincere
which, in his inaugural address, he had paid
the Republican and Federalist parties, saying of
them that both had "contributed splendid talents,
spotless integrity, ardent patriotism, and disinterested
sacrifices to the formation and administra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>tion"
of the government. But it was idle for him
to suppose that the successors of these parties, although
from both had come his own supporters,
and although, as in his offer of the treasury to
Crawford, he showed his desire, even in the chief
offices, to ignore political differences, would remain
united under him, if he espoused causes upon
which they widely differed. After recapitulating
the tenets of American political faith, and showing
that most discordant elements of public opinion
were now blended into harmony, he was again perfectly
sincere in saying that only an effort of magnanimity
needed to be made, that individuals should
discard every remnant of rancor against each other.
This advice he was himself unable to follow; and
so were other men. In his inaugural he distinctly
adopted as his own the policy of internal improvements
by the federal government, although he
knew how wide and determined had been the opposition
to it. His own late chief, Monroe, had
pronounced the policy unconstitutional. But he
now told the people that the magnificence and splendor
of the public works, the roads and aqueducts,
of Rome, were among the imperishable splendors
of the ancient republic. He asked to what single
individual our first national road had proved an
injury. Of the constitutional doubts which were
raised, he said, with a touch of the contempt of a
practical administrator: "Every speculative scruple
will be solved by a practical blessing." To the
self-consecrated guardians of the Constitution this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
was as corrupt as offers of largesses to plebeians at
Rome. In his first message he recommended again
the policy of internal improvements, and proposed
the establishment of a national university. Although
he admitted the Constitution to be "a
charter of limited powers," he still intimated his
opinion that its powers might "be effectually
brought into action by laws promoting the improvement
of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures,
the cultivation and encouragement of the mechanic
and of the elegant arts, the advancement of literature,
and the progress of the sciences, ornamental
and profound;" and that to refrain from exercising
these powers for the benefit of the people themselves,
would be to hide the talent in the earth,
and a "treachery to the most sacred of trusts."
Further, he now broached the novel project of the
congress at Panama,&mdash;a project surely doubtful
enough to permit conscientious opposition.</p>

<p>All this was widely different from the messages
of content from President Monroe. There was in
these new utterances a clear political diversion,
marked not less by the brilliant and restless genius
of Henry Clay, now the secretary of state, than
by the President's consciousness of his own strong
and disciplined ability. Here was a new policy
formally presented by a new administration; and
a formal and organized resistance was as sure to
follow as effect to follow cause. Van Buren was
soon at the head of this inevitable opposition. It
is difficult, at least in the records of Congress, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
find any evidence justifying the long tradition that
the opposition was factious or unworthy. It was
doubtless a warfare, with its surprises, its skirmishes,
and its pitched battles. Mistakes of the
adversary were promptly used. Debates were not
had simply to promote the formal business before
the House, but rather to reach the listening voters.
But all this belongs to parliamentary warfare. Nor
is it inconsistent with most exalted aims and an
admirable performance of public business in a free
country. Gladstone, the greatest living master in
the work of political reform, has described himself
as an "old parliamentary hand." Nor in the
motions, the resolutions, the debates, led by Van
Buren during his three years of opposition, can
one find any device which Palmerston or Derby or
Gladstone in one forum, and Seward and even
Adams himself in his last and best years in another,
have not used with little punishment from
disinterested and enduring criticism.</p>

<p>Immediately after Adams's inauguration Van
Buren voted for Clay's confirmation as secretary
of state, while Jackson and fourteen other senators,
including Hayne, voted to reject him, upon the
unfounded story of Clay's sale of the presidency to
Adams for the office to which he was now nominated.
Van Buren's language and demeanor towards
the new administration were uniformly becoming.
He charged political but not personal
wrong-doing; he made no insinuation of base motives;
and his opposition throughout was the more
forcible for its very decorum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The first great battle between the rapidly dividing
forces was over the Panama mission, a creation
of Clay's exuberant imagination. The president
nominated to the Senate two envoys to an American
congress called by the new South American republics
of Columbia, Mexico, and Central America,
and in which it was proposed that Peru and Chile
also should participate. The congress was to be
held at Panama, which, in the extravagant rhetoric
of some of the Republicans of the South, would, if
the world had to elect a capital, be pointed out for
that august destiny, placed as it was "in the centre
of the globe." Spain had not yet acknowledged
the independence of her revolted colonies; and it
was clear that the discussions of the congress must
be largely concerned with a mutual protection of
American nations which implied an attitude hostile
to Spain. Adams, in his message nominating the
envoys, declared that they were not to take part in
deliberations of belligerent character, or to contract
alliances or to engage in any project importing
hostility to any other nation. But referring to the
Monroe doctrine, Adams said that the mission
looked to an agreement between the nations represented,
that each would guard by its own means
against the establishment of any future European
colony within its borders; and it looked also to an
effort on the part of the United States to promote
religious liberty among those intolerant republics.
The decisive inducement, he added, to join in the
congress was to lay the foundation of future inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>course
with those states "in the broadest principles
of reciprocity and the most cordial feelings of fraternal
friendship."</p>

<p>This was vague enough. But when the diplomatic
papers were exhibited, it was plain that the
southern republics proposed a congress looking to
a close defensive alliance, a sort of confederacy or
Amphictyonic council as Benton described it; and
that it was highly improbable that the representatives
from one country could responsibly participate
in the congress without most serious danger of
incurring obligations, or falling into precisely the
embarrassments which the well settled policy of
the United States had avoided. It was perfectly
agreeable to Adams, resolute and aggressive American
that he was, that his country should look
indulgently upon the smaller American powers,
should stand at their head, should counsel them in
their difficulties with European nations, and jealously
take their side in those difficulties. Clay's
eager, enthusiastic mind delighted in the picture of
a great leadership of America by the United States,
an American system of nations, breathing the air
of republicanism, asserting a young and haughty
independence of monarchical Europe, and ready
for opposition to its schemes. In all this there
has been fascination to many American minds,
which even in our own day we have seen influence
American diplomacy. But it was a step into the
entangling alliances against which American public
opinion had from Washington's day been set.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
When Adams asked an appropriation for the expenses
of the mission, he told the House of Representatives
that he was hardly sanguine enough to
promise "all or even any of the transcendent benefits
to the human race which warmed the conceptions
of its first proposer," but that it looked "to
the melioration of the condition of man;" that it
was congenial with the spirit which prompted our
own declaration of independence, which dictated
our first treaty with Prussia, and "which filled the
hearts and fired the souls of the immortal founders
of our revolution."</p>

<p>Such fanciful speculation the Republicans, led
by Van Buren, opposed with strong and heated
protests, in tone not unlike the Liberal protests of
1878 in England against Disraeli's Jingo policy.
In the secret session of the Senate Van Buren proposed
resolutions against the constitutionality of
the mission, reciting that it was a departure from
our wise and settled policy; that, for the conference
and discussion contemplated, our envoys already
accredited to the new republics were competent,
without becoming involved as members of the congress.
These resolutions, so the President at once
wrote in his opulent and invaluable diary, "are
the fruit of the ingenuity of Martin Van Buren
and bear the impress of his character." The mission
was, the opposition thus insisted, unconstitutional;
a step enlarging the sphere of the federal
government; a meddlesome and dangerous interference
with foreign nations; and if it lay in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
course of a strong and splendid policy, it was also
part of a policy full of warlike possibilities almost
sure to drag us into old-world quarrels. Clay's
"American system," Hayne said in the senatorial
debate, meant restriction and monopoly when applied
to our domestic policy, and "entangling alliances"
when applied to our foreign policy.</p>

<p>Van Buren's speech was very able. He did not
touch upon the liberality of the Spanish Americans
towards races other than the Caucasian, which
peered out of Hayne's speech as one of the Southern
objections. After using the wise and seemingly
pertinent language of Washington against such
foreign involvements, Van Buren skillfully referred
to the very Prussian treaty which the President
had cited in his message to the House. The elder
Adams, the Senate was reminded, had departed
from the rule commended by his great predecessor.
He had told his first Congress that we were indeed
to keep ourselves distinct and separate from the
political system of Europe "if we can," but that
we needed early and continual information of political
projects in contemplation; that however we
might consider ourselves, others would consider us
a weight in the balance of power in Europe, which
never could be forgotten or neglected; and that it
was natural for us, studying to be neutral, to consult
with other nations engaged in the same study.
The younger Adams had been, Van Buren pointed
out, appointed upon the Berlin mission to carry
out these heretical suggestions of his father. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Republicans of that day had vigorously opposed
the mission; and for their opposition were denounced
as a faction, and lampooned and vilified
"by all the presses supporting and supported by
the government, and a host of malicious parasites
generaled by its patronage." But, covered with
Washington's mantle, the Republicans of '98 had
sought to strangle at its birth this political hydra,
this first attempt since the establishment of the
government to subject our political affairs to the
terms and conditions of political connection with a
foreign nation. Probably anticipating the success
of the administration senators by a majority of
five, Van Buren ingeniously reminded the Senate
that those early Republicans had failed with a
majority of four against them. But it was to be
remembered, he continued, that after a few more
such Federalist victories the ruin of Federalism
had been complete. Its doctrines had speedily
received popular condemnation. The new administration
under the presidency of that early minister
to Prussia had returned to the practices of the
Federalist party, to which Van Buren with courteous
indirection let it be remembered that the
president had originally belonged. Except a guaranty
to Spain of its dominions beyond the Mississippi,
which Jefferson had offered as part of the
price of a cession of the territory between that
river and the Mobile, the administrations of Jefferson,
Madison, and Monroe had strictly followed
the admonition of Washington: "Peace, com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>merce,
and honest friendship with all nations, entangling
alliances with none." If we were asked
to form a connection with European states, such
as was proposed with the southern republics, Van
Buren argued, no American would approve it; and
there was no sound reason, there was nothing but
fanciful sentiment, to induce us to distinguish between
the states of Europe and those of South
America. Grant that there was a Holy Alliance
in monarchical Europe, was it not a hollow glory,
inconsistent with a sober view of American interests,
to create a holy alliance in republican
America? It might indeed be easy to agree upon
speculative opinions with our younger neighbors at
the south; but we should be humiliated in their
eyes, and difficulties would at once arise, when
means of promoting those opinions were proposed,
and we were then to say we could talk but not
fight. The Monroe doctrine was not to be withdrawn;
but we ought to be left free to act upon it
without the burden of promises, express or implied.
The proposed congress was a specious and disguised
step towards an American confederacy, full
of embarrassment, full of danger; and the first
step should be firmly resisted. Such was the outline
of Van Buren's argument; and its wisdom has
commanded a general assent from that day.</p>

<p>Dickerson of New Jersey very well phrased
sound American sentiment when he said in the
debate that, next to a passion for war, he dreaded
a passion for diplomacy. The majestic declama<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>tion
of Webster, his pathetic picture of a South
America once oppressed but now emancipated, his
eloquent cry that if it were weak to feel that he
was an American it was a weakness from which he
claimed no exemption,&mdash;all this met a good deal
of exuberant response through the country. But
it failed, as in our history most such efforts have
failed, to convince the practical judgment of Americans,
a judgment never long dazzled or inspired
by the picture of an America wielding enormous
or dominant international power. The Panama
congress met in the absence of the American representatives,
who had been delayed. It made a
treaty of friendship and perpetual confederation
to which all other American powers might accede
within a year. The congress was to meet annually
in time of common war, and biennially in times of
peace. But it never met again. The "centre of
the world" was too far away from its very neighbors.
Even South American republics could not
be kept together by effusions of republican glory
and international love.</p>

<p>In spite of its victory in Congress, Adams's
administration had plainly opened with a serious
mistake. The opposition was perfectly legitimate;
and although in the debate it was spoken of as
unorganized, it certainly came out of the debate a
pretty definite party. Before the debate Adams
had written in his diary, and truly, that it was the
first subject upon which a great effort had been
made "to combine the discordant elements of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Crawford and Jackson and Calhoun men into
a united opposition against the administration."
Although some of the Southern opposition was
heated by a dislike of States in which negroes
were to be administrators, the division was not
at all upon a North and South line. With Van
Buren voted Findlay of Pennsylvania, Chandler
and Holmes of Maine, Woodbury of New Hampshire,
Dickerson of New Jersey, Kane of Illinois,
making seven Northern with twelve Southern senators.
Against Van Buren were eight senators
from slave States, Barton of Missouri, Bouligny
and Johnston of Louisiana, Chambers of Alabama,
Clayton and Van Dyke of Delaware, Richard M.
Johnson of Kentucky, and Smith of Maryland.
It was an incipient but a true party division.</p>

<p>Throughout this session of 1824-25 Van Buren
was very industrious in the Senate, and nearly, if
not quite, its most conspicuous member, if account
be not taken of Randolph's furious and blazing
talents. Calhoun was only in the chair as vice-president;
the great duel between him and Van
Buren not yet begun. Clay was at the head of
the cabinet, and Webster in the lower House.
Jackson was in Tennessee, watching with angry
confidence, and aiding, the rising tide with the
political dexterity in which he was by no means a
novice. Having only a minority with him, and
with Benton frequently against him, Van Buren
gradually drilled his party into opposition on internal
improvements,&mdash;a most legitimate and im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>portant
issue. In December, 1825, he threw down
the gauntlet to the administration, or rather took
up its gauntlet. He proposed a resolution "that
Congress does not possess the power to make roads
and canals within the respective States." At the
same time he asked for a committee to prepare a
constitutional amendment on the subject like his
earlier proposal, saying with a touch of very polite
partisanship that though the President's recent declaration,
that the power clearly existed in the Constitution,
might diminish, it did not obviate the
necessity of an amendment. In March, April, and
May, 1826, he opposed appropriations of $110,000
to continue the Cumberland road, and of $50,000
for surveys preparatory to roads and canals, and
subscriptions to stock of the Louisville and Portland
Canal Company and of the Dismal Swamp
Canal Company. All these were distinctly administration
measures.</p>

<p>Although the principles advanced by Van Buren
in this part of his opposition have not since obtained
complete and unanimous affirmance, they
have at least commanded so large, honorable, and
prolonged support, that his attitude can with little
good sense be considered one of factious difference.
Especially wise was he on the question of government
subscriptions to private canal companies.
Upon one of these bills he said, in May, 1826,
that he did not believe that the government had
the constitutional power to make canals or to grant
money for them; but he added that, if he believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
otherwise, the grant of money should, he thought,
be made directly, and not by forming a partnership
between the government and a private corporation.
In 1824 he had voted for the road from
Missouri to New Mexico; but this stood, as the
Pacific railway later stood, upon a different principle,
the former as a road entirely without state
limits and a means of international commerce, and
the latter a road chiefly through federal territories,
and of obvious national importance in the war between
the North and the South.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment of the Constitution
to prevent the election of president by a vote of
States in the House of Representatives, upon which
Van Buren had spoken in 1824, had now acquired
new interest. Van Buren seized Adams's election
in the House as a good subject for political warfare;
and it was clearly a legitimate topic for party
discussion and division. Van Buren would have
been far more exalted in his notions of political
agitation than the greatest of political leaders, had
he not sought to use the popular feeling, that the
American will had been subverted by the decision
of the House, to promote his plan of constitutional
reform. He told the Senate in May, 1826, that he
was satisfied that there was no one point on which
the people of the United States were more perfectly
united than upon the propriety of taking the
choice of president from the House. But Congress
was not ready for the change; however much in
theory was to be said against the clumsy system<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
which nearly made Burr president in 1801,<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
which produced in 1825 a choice which Adams
himself declared that he would vacate if the Constitution
provided a mode of doing it.</p>

<p>As chairman of the judiciary committee, Van
Buren participated in a most laborious effort to
enlarge the federal judiciary. Upon the question
whether the judges of the Supreme Court should
be relieved from circuit duty, he made an elaborate
and very able speech upon the negative side.
The opportunity arose for a disquisition on the
danger of centralized government, and for a renewal
of the criticisms he had made in the New
York Constitutional Convention upon the common
and absurd picture of judges as dwellers in an
atmosphere above all human infirmity, and beyond
the reach of popular impression. Van Buren said,
what all sensible men know, that in spite of every
effort, incompetent men will sometimes reach the
judicial bench. If always sitting among associates
<i>in banc</i>, their incompetence would be shielded, he
said, by their abler brethren. But if regularly
compelled to perform their great duties alone and
in the direct face of the people, and not in the
isolation of Washington, there was another constraint,
Van Buren said very democratically and
with substantial truth. "There is a power in pub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>lic
opinion in this country," he declared, "and I
thank God for it, for it is the most honest and best
of all powers, which will not tolerate an incompetent
or unworthy man to hold in his weak or
wicked hands the lives and fortunes of his fellow
citizens." He added an expression to which he
would afterwards have given most narrow interpretation.
The Supreme Court stood, he said, "as
the umpire between the conflicting powers of the
general and state governments." There was in
the speech very plain though courteous intimation
of that jealousy with which Van Buren's party examined
the political utterances of the court from
Jefferson's time until, years after Van Buren's retirement,
the party found it convenient to receive
from the court, with a sanctimonious air of veneration,
the most odious and demoralizing of all its
expressions of political opinion. In arguing for a
close and democratic relation between the judges
and the different parts of the country, and against
their dignified and exalted seclusion at Washington
which was so agreeable to many patriotic Americans,
Van Buren said, in a passage which is fairly
characteristic of his oratorical manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A sentiment I had almost said of idolatry for the
Supreme Court has grown up, which claims for its members
an almost entire exemption from the fallibilities of
our nature, and arraigns with unsparing bitterness the
motives of all who have the temerity to look with inquisitive
eyes into this consecrated sanctuary of the law.
So powerful has this sentiment become, such strong hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
has it taken upon the press of this country, that it
requires not a little share of firmness in a public man,
however imperious may be his duty, to express sentiments
that conflict with it. It is nevertheless correct, sir, that
in this, as in almost every other case, the truth is to be
found in a just medium of the subject. To so much of
the high-wrought eulogies (which the fashion of the times
has recently produced in such great abundance) as allows
to the distinguished men who now hold in their hands
that portion of the administration of public affairs, talents
of the highest order, and spotless integrity, I cheerfully
add the very humble testimony of my unqualified
assent. That the uncommon man who now presides
over the court, and who I hope may long continue to do
so, is, in all human probability, the ablest judge now
sitting upon any judicial bench in the world, I sincerely
believe. But to the sentiment which claims for the
judges so great a share of exemption from the feelings
that govern the conduct of other men, and for the court
the character of being the safest depository of political
power, I do not subscribe. I have been brought up in
an opposite faith, and all my experience has confirmed
me in its correctness. In my legislation upon this subject
I will act in conformity to those opinions. I believe
the judges of the Supreme Court (great and good men as
I cheerfully concede them to be) are subject to the
same infirmities, influenced by the same passions, and
operated upon by the same causes, that good and great
men are in other situations. I believe they have as
much of the <i>esprit de corps</i> as other men. Those who
think<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> otherwise form an erroneous estimate of human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
nature; and if they act upon that estimate, will, soon or
late, become sensible of their delusion."</p></div>

<p>At this session, upon the election by the Senate
of their temporary president, Van Buren received
the compliment of four votes. In May, 1826, he
participated in Benton's report on the reduction of
executive patronage, a subject important enough,
but there crudely treated. The report strongly
exhibited the jealousy of executive power which
had long been characteristic of American political
thought. By describing the offices within the president's
appointment, their numbers and salaries, and
the expense of the civil list, a striking picture was
drawn&mdash;and in that way a striking picture can always
be drawn&mdash;of the power of any great executive.
By imagining serious abuses of power, the
picture was darkened with the dangers of patronage,
as it could be darkened to-day. The country
was urged to look forward to the time when public
revenue would be doubled, when the number of
public officers would be quadrupled, when the president's
nomination would carry any man through
the Senate, and his recommendation any measure
through Congress. Names, the report said, were
nothing. The first Roman emperor was styled
Emperor of the Republic; and the late French
emperor had taken a like title. The American
president, it was hinted, might by his enormous
patronage and by subsidies to the press, nominally
for official advertisements, subject us to a like danger.
But the usefulness of such pictures as these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of Benton and Van Buren depends upon the practical
lesson taught by the artists. If there were
disadvantages and dangers which our ancestors
rightly feared, in placing the federal patronage
under the sole control of the president, so there
are disadvantages and dangers in scattering it by
laws into various hands, or in its subjection to the
traditions of "senatorial courtesy."</p>

<p>Six bills accompanied the report. Two of them
proposed the appointment of military cadets and
midshipmen, one of each from every congressional
district; and this was afterwards done, giving a
petty patronage to national legislators which public
sentiment has but recently begun to compel them
to use upon ascertained merit rather than in sheer
favoritism. A third bill proposed that military
and naval commissions should run "during good
behavior" and not "during the pleasure of the
president." A fourth sought with extraordinary
unwisdom to correct the old but ever new abuse of
government advertising, by depriving the responsible
executive of its distribution and by placing it
in the hands of congressmen, perhaps the very
worst to hold it. Another required senatorial confirmation
for postmasters whose emoluments exceeded
an amount to be fixed. The remaining bill
was very wise, and a natural sequence of Benton's
not untruthful though too highly colored picture.
The law of 1820, which fixed at four years the
terms of many subordinate officers, was to be modified
so as to limit the terms only for officers who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
had not satisfactorily accounted for public moneys.
It has been commonly said that this act was a
device of Crawford, when secretary of the treasury,
more easily to use federal patronage for his presidential
canvass. But there seems to be no sufficient
reason to doubt that Benton's and Van
Buren's committee correctly stated the intent of
the authors of the law to have been no more than
that the officer should be definitely compelled by
the expiration of his term to render his accounts
and have them completely audited; that it was not
intended that some other person should succeed an
officer not found in fault; and that the practice of
refusing re-commissions to deserving officers was
an unexpected perversion of the law. The committee
simply proposed to accomplish the true
intent of the law. The same bill required the
president to state his reasons for removals of officers
when he nominated their successors. The
proposals in the last two bills were very creditable
to Benton and Van Buren and their coadjutors. It
is greatly to be lamented that they were not safely
made laws while patronage was dispensed conscientiously
and with sincere public spirit by the
younger Adams, so far as he could control it. The
biographer has more particularly to lament that
during the twelve years of Van Buren's executive
influence he seemed daunted by the difficulties of
voluntarily putting in practice the admirable rules
which as a senator he would have imposed by law
upon those in executive stations. It was only three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
years after this report, that the great chieftain,
whom Benton and Van Buren helped to the presidency,
discredited all its reasoning by proposing
"a general extension" of the law whose operation
they would have thus limited. The committee also
proposed by constitutional amendment to forbid
the appointment to office of any senator or representative
until the end of the presidential term in
which he had held his seat. This was also one of
the reforms whose necessity seems plain enough to
the reformer, until in office he discovers the conveniences
and perhaps the public uses of the practice
he has wished to abolish.</p>

<p>In the short session of 1826-1827, little of any
importance was done. Van Buren refused to vote
with Benton to abolish the duty on salt, a vote
doubtless influenced by the apparent interest of
New York, which itself taxed the production of
salt to aid the State in its internal improvements,
and which probably could not maintain the tax if
foreign salt were admitted free. Van Buren did
not, indeed, avow, nor did he disavow this reason.
He was content to point out that the great canals
of New York were of national use, though their
expense was borne by his State alone. He voted
at this session for lower duties on teas, coffees,
and wines. He did not join Benton and others in
their narrow unwillingness to establish a naval academy.
Van Buren's temper was eminently free
from raw prejudices against disciplined education.
The death of one of the envoys to the Panama<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
congress enabled him again at this session to renew
his opposition by a vote against filling the vacancy.
Another attempt was made to pass a bankruptcy
bill; but again it failed through the natural and
wholesome dislike of increasing the powers of the
federal judiciary, and the preference that state
courts and laws should perform all the work to
which they were reasonably competent. The bill
did not even pass the Senate, until by Van Buren's
opposition it had been reduced to a bill establishing
a summary and speedy remedy for creditors against
fraudulent or failing traders, instead of a general
system of bankruptcy, voluntary and involuntary,
for all persons. Van Buren's speech against the
insolvency features of the bill was made on January
23, 1827, only a few days before his successor as
senator was to be chosen. But the thoughtless
popularity which often accompanies sweeping propositions
of relief to insolvents did not move him
from resolute and successful opposition to what he
called (and later experience has most abundantly
justified him) "an injurious extension of the patronage
of the federal government, and an insupportable
enlargement of the range of its judicial
power." On February 24, 1827, a few days after
his re&euml;lection, he delivered a lucid and elaborate
speech on the long-perplexing topic of the restrictions
upon American trade with the British colonies,
a subject to be afterwards closely connected
with his political fortunes.</p>

<p>The agitation of the coming presidential election<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
left little of its turbulence upon the records of the
long session from December, 1827, to May, 1828.
Van Buren was doubtless busy enough out of the
senate chamber. But he was still a very busy
legislator. He spoke at least twice in favor of the
bill to abolish imprisonment under judgments rendered
by federal courts for debts not fraudulently
incurred, the bill which Richard M. Johnson had
pressed so long and so honorably; and at last he
saw the bill pass in January, 1828. He spoke
often upon the technical bill to regulate federal
judicial process. Again he voted, and again in a
minority and in opposition to Benton and other
political friends, against bills to extend the Cumberland
road and for other internal improvements.
Besides the usual bills to appropriate lands for
roads and canals, and to subscribe to the stock of
private canal companies, a step further was now
taken in the constitutional change led by Adams
and Clay. Public land was voted for the benefit
of Kenyon College, in the State of Ohio. There
was plainly intended to be no limit to federal beneficence.
In this session Van Buren again rushed
to defend the salt duty so dear to New York.</p>

<p>At the same session was passed the "tariff of
abominations," a measure so called from the oppressive
provisions loaded on it by its enemies, but
in spite of which it passed. Van Buren, though
he sat still during the debate, cast for the bill a
protectionist vote, with Benton and several others
whose convictions were against it, but who yielded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to the supposed public sentiment or the peremptory
instructions of their States, or who did not yet dare
to make upon the tariff a presidential issue. The
votes of the senators were sectionally thus distributed:
For the tariff,&mdash;New England, 6; Middle
States, 8; Louisiana, 1; and the Western States,
11; in all 26. Against it,&mdash;New England, 5;
Maryland, 2; Southern States, 13; and Tennessee,
1. It was a victory of neither political party, but
of the Middle and Western over the Southern
States. Only three negative votes were cast by
senators who had voted against the administration
on the Panama question in 1826; while of the votes
for the tariff, fourteen were cast by senators who
had then opposed the administration. Of the senators
in favor of the tariff, six, Van Buren, Benton,
Dickerson of New Jersey, Eaton of Tennessee
(Jackson's close friend), Kane of Illinois, and
Rowan of Kentucky, had in 1826 been in opposition,
while ten of those voting against the tariff
had then been with them.<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The greater number
of the opposition senators were therefore against
the tariff, though very certainly the votes of Van
Buren, Benton, and Eaton prevented the opposition
from taking strong ground or suffering injury on
the tariff in the election. Van Buren's silence in
this debate of 1828 indicated at least a temper
now hesitant. But he and his colleague, Sanford,
according to the theory then popular that senators
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>were simply delegated agents of their States, were
constrained, whatever were their opinions, by a
resolution of the legislature of New York passed
almost unanimously in January, 1828. It stated
a sort of <i>ultima ratio</i> of protection, commanding
the senators "to make every proper exertion to
effect such a revision of the tariff as will afford a
sufficient protection to the growers of wool, hemp,
and flax, and the manufacturers of iron, woolens,
and every other article, so far as the same may be
connected with the interest of manufactures, agriculture,
and commerce." The senators might perhaps
have said to this that, if they were to protect
not only iron and woolens but also every other
article, they ought not to levy prohibitory duties
on some and not on other articles; that if they
were equally to protect manufactures, agriculture,
and commerce, they could do no better than to
let natural laws alone. But the silly instruction
said what no intelligent protectionist means; his
system disappears with an equality of privilege;
that equality must, he argues, at some point yield
to practical necessities. Van Buren took the resolution,
however, in its intended meaning, and
not literally. Hayne concluded his fine struggle
against the bill by a solemn protest upon its passage
that it was a partial, unjust, and unconstitutional
measure.</p>

<p>At this session Van Buren, upon the consideration
of a rule giving the Vice-President power to
call to order for words spoken in debate, made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
perhaps the most elaborate of his purely political
speeches. It was a skillful and not unsuccessful
effort to give philosophical significance to the
coming struggle at the polls. He spoke of "that
collision, which seems to be inseparable from the
nature of man, between the rights of the few and
the many," of "those never-ceasing conflicts between
the advocates of the enlargement and concentration
of power on the one hand, and its limitation
and distribution on the other." The one
party, he said, had "grown out of a deep and
settled distrust of the people and of the States:"
the other, out of "a jealousy of power justified
by all human experience." The advocates of "a
strong government," having been defeated in much
that they sought in the federal convention, had
since, he said, "been at work to obtain by construction
what was not included or intended to be
included in the grant." He declared the incorporation
of the United States Bank to be the "great
pioneer of constitutional encroachments." Thence
had followed those famous usurpations, the alien
and sedition laws of the older Adams's administration.
Then came the doctrine that the House of
Representatives was bound to make all appropriations
necessary to carry out a treaty made by the
President and Senate; and then "the bold avowal
that it belonged to the President alone to decide
upon the propriety" of a foreign mission, and that
it was for the Senate only "to pass on the fitness
of the individuals selected as ministers." He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
lamented the single lapse of Madison, "one of
the most, if not the most, accomplished statesman
that our country has produced," in signing the bill
to incorporate the new bank. The younger Adams,
Van Buren declared, had "gone far beyond the
utmost latitude of construction" therefore claimed;
and he added a reference, decorous enough but
neither fair nor gracious, to Adams's own early
entrance in the public service upon a mission unauthorized
by Congress. It was now demonstrated,
he said, that the result of the presidential choice
of 1825 "was not only the restoration of the men
of 1798, but of the principles of that day." The
spirit of encroachment had, it was true, become
more wary; but it was no more honest. The
system had then been coercion; now it was seduction.
Then unconstitutional powers had been exercised
to force submission; now they were assumed
to purchase golden opinions from the people
with their own means. Isolated acts of the Federalists
had not produced an unyielding exclusion
from the confidence of a majority of the people,
for more than a quarter of a century, of large
masses of men distinguished for talent and private
worth. The great and glorious struggle had proceeded
from something deeper, an opposition to the
principle of an extension of the constructive powers
of the government. Without harsh denunciation,
and by suggestion rather than assertion, the administration
of John Quincy Adams was grouped
with the administration of his father. The earlier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
administration had deserved and met the retribution
of a Republican victory. The later one now
deserved and ought soon to meet a like fate.</p>

<p>The issue was clearly made. The parties were
formed. The result rested with the people. On
February 6, 1827, Van Buren had been re&euml;lected
senator by a large majority in both houses of the
New York legislature. In his brief letter of acceptance
he said no more on public questions than that
it should be his "constant and zealous endeavor to
protect the remaining rights reserved to the States
by the federal Constitution," and "to restore those
of which they have been divested by construction."
This had been the main burden of his political
oratory from the inauguration of Adams. There
are many references in books to doubts of Van
Buren's position until 1827; but such doubts are
not justified in the face of his prompt and perfectly
explicit utterances in the session of 1825-1826, and
from that time steadily on.</p>

<p>De Witt Clinton's death on February 11, 1828,
removed from the politics of New York one of its
most illustrious men, a statesman of the first rank,
able and passionate, and of the noblest aspirations.
The understanding reached between him and Van
Buren in 1826, for the support of Jackson, had not
produced a complete coalition. In spite of the
union on Jackson, the Bucktails nominated and
Van Buren loyally supported for governor against
Clinton in 1826, William B. Rochester, a warm
friend and supporter of Adams and Clay, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of the members of the very Panama mission against
which so strenuous a fight had been made. Clinton
was re&euml;lected by a small majority. In a meeting
at Washington after his death, Van Buren declared
the triumph of his talents and patriotism to be
monuments of high and enduring fame. He was
glad that, though in their public careers there had
been "collisions of opinions and action at once extensive,
earnest, and enduring," they had still been
"wholly free from that most venomous and corroding
of all poisons, personal hatred." These collisions
were now "turned to nothing and less than
nothing." Speaking of his respect for Clinton's
name and gratitude for his signal services, Van
Buren concluded with this striking tribute: "For
myself, so strong, so sincere, and so engrossing is
that feeling, that I, who whilst living, never&mdash;no,
never, envied him anything, now that he has
fallen, am greatly tempted to envy him his grave
with its honors."</p>

<p>With this session of 1827-1828 ended Van
Buren's senatorial career and his parliamentary
leadership. From 1821 to 1828 the Senate was
not indeed at its greatest glory. Webster entered
it only in December, 1827. Hayne and Benton
with Van Buren are to us its most distinguished
members, if Randolph's rather indescribable and
useless personality may be excepted. But to neither
of them has the opinion of later times assigned
a place in the first rank of orators, although
Hayne's tariff speech in 1824 deserves to be set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
with the greatest of American political orations.
The records and speeches of the Senate in which
Van Buren sat have come to us with fine print
and narrow margins; they have not contributed to
the collected works of great men. But the Senate
was then an able body. The principles of American
politics were never more clearly stated. When
the books are well dusted, and one has broken
through the starched formality in which the speakers'
phrases were set, he finds a copious fund of
political instruction. The federal Senate was more
truly a parliamentary body in those formative days
than perhaps at any other period. Several at least
of its members were in doubt as to the political
course they should follow; they were in doubt
where they should find their party associations.
To them, debates had therefore a real and present
significance. There were some votes to be affected,
there were converts to be gained, by speeches even
on purely political questions; there were some senators
whose votes were not inexorably determined
for them by the will of their parties or their constituents.
Much that was said had therefore a
genuine parliamentary ring. The orators really
sought to convince and persuade those who heard
them within the easy and almost conversational
limits of the old senate chamber. There was little
of the mere pronouncing of essays or declamations
intended to have their real and only effect elsewhere.
In this art of true parliamentary speaking
rather than oratory, Van Buren was a master such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
as Lord Palmerston afterwards became. He was
not eloquent. His speeches, so far as they are
preserved, interest the student of political history
and not of literature. They are sensible, clear,
practical arguments made in rather finished sentences.
One does not find quotations from them
in books of school declamation. But they served
far more effectively the primary end of parliamentary
speaking than did the elaborate and powerful
disquisitions of Calhoun, or the more splendid flood
of Webster's eloquence. Van Buren's speeches
were intended to convince, and they did convince
some of the men in the seats about him. They
were meant to persuade, and they did persuade.
They were lucid exhibitions of political principles,
generally practical, and touched sufficiently but
not morbidly with the theoretical fears so common
to our earlier politics. Some of those fears have
since been shown to be groundless; but out of
many of them has come much that is best in the
modern temper of American political institutions.
Van Buren's speeches did not rise beyond the reach
of popular understanding, although they never
warmly touched popular sympathy. They were intended
to formulate and spread a political faith in
which he plainly saw that there was the material
of a party,&mdash;a faith founded upon the jealousy of
federal activity, however beneficent, which sought
to avoid state control or encourage state dependence.
The prolixity which was a grave fault of
his state papers and political letters was far less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
exhibited in his oratorical efforts. His style was
generally easy and vigorous, with little of the turgid
learning which loaded down many sensible
speeches of the time. Now and then, however, he
resorted to the sentences of stilted formality which
sometimes overtake a good public speaker, as a
good actor sometimes lapses into the stage strut.</p>

<p>In Van Buren's senatorial speeches there is nothing
to justify the charge of "non-committalism"
so much made against him. When he spoke at
all he spoke explicitly; and he plainly, though
without acerbity, exhibited his likes and dislikes.
Jackson was struck with this when he sat in the
Senate with him. "I had heard a great deal about
Mr. Van Buren," he said, "especially about his
non-committalism. I made up my mind that I
would take an early opportunity to hear him and
judge for myself. One day an important subject
was under debate in the Senate. I noticed that
Mr. Van Buren was taking notes while one of the
senators was speaking. I judged from this that
he intended to reply, and I determined to be in
my seat when he spoke. His turn came; and he
rose and made a clear, straightforward argument,
which, to my mind, disposed of the whole subject.
I turned to my colleague, Major Eaton, who sat
next to me. 'Major,' said I, 'is there anything
non-committal about that?' 'No, sir,' said the
major." Van Buren scrupulously observed the
amenities of debate. He was uniformly courteous
towards adversaries; and the calm self-control<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
saved him, as some greater orators were not saved,
from a descent to the aspersion of motive so common
and so futile in political debate. He could
not, indeed, help now and then an allusion to the
venality and monarchical tendency of the Federalists
and their successors; but this was an old
formula which strong haters had years before made
very popular in the Republican phrase-book, and
which, as to the venality, meant nobody in particular.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="ft80">DEMOCRATIC VICTORY IN 1828.&mdash;GOVERNOR</span></h2>


<p>When in May, 1828, Van Buren left Washington,
the country universally recognized him as the
chief organizer of the new party and its congressional
leader. As such he turned all his skill and
industry to win a victory for Jackson and Calhoun.
There was never in the history of the United States
a more legitimate presidential canvass than that of
1828. The rival candidates distinctly stood for
conflicting principles of federal administration.
On the one side, under Van Buren's shrewd management,
with the theoretical co&ouml;peration of Calhoun,&mdash;the
natural bent of whose mind was now
aided and not thwarted by the exigencies of his
personal career,&mdash;was the party inclined to strict
limitation of federal powers, jealous for local powers,
hostile to internal improvements by the federal
government, inclined to a lower rather than a
higher tariff. On the other side was the party
strongly national in temper, with splendid conceptions
of a powerful and multifariously useful
central administration, impatient of the poverties
and meannesses of many of the States. The latter
party was led by a president with ampler training<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in public life than any American of his time, who
sincerely and intelligently believed the principles
of his party; and his party held those principles
firmly, explicitly, and with practical unanimity.
Jefferson, in almost his last letter, written in December,
1825, to William B. Giles, a venerable
leader of the Democracy, the "Charles James Fox
of Congress," Benton's "statesman of head and
tongue," recalled indeed Adams's superiority over
all ordinary considerations when the safety of his
country had been questioned; but Jefferson declared
himself in "the deepest affliction" at the
usurpations by which the federal branch, through
the decisions of the federal court, the doctrines of
the President, and the misconstructions of Congress,
was stripping its "colleagues, the state authorities,
of the powers reserved to them." The
voice from Monticello, feeble with its eighty-three
years, and secretly uttered though it was, sounded
the summons to a new Democratic battle.</p>

<p>Van Buren and his coadjutors, however, led a
party as yet of inclination to principles rather than
of principles. It was out of power. There was
neither warmth nor striking exaltation in its programme.
Its philosophical and political wisdom
needed the aid of one of those simple cries for justice
which are so potent in political warfare, and
a leader to interest and fire the popular temper.
Both were at hand. The late defeat of the popular
will by the Adams-Clay coalition was the cry;
the hero of the military victory most grateful to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Americans was the leader. To this cry and this
leader Van Buren skillfully harnessed an intelligible,
and at the least a reasonable, political creed.
There were thus united nearly all the elements of
political strength. Not indeed all, for the record
of the leader was weak upon several articles of
faith. Jackson had voted in the Senate for internal
improvement bills, and among them bills of
the most obnoxious character, those authorizing
subscriptions to the stocks of private corporations.
He had voted against reductions of the tariff. But
the votes, it was hoped, exhibited only his inexpertness
in applying general principles to actual
legislation, or a good-natured willingness to please
his constituents by single votes comparatively unimportant.
In truth these mistakes were really
inconsistencies of the politician, and no more.
There had been a long inclination on Jackson's
part to the Jeffersonian policy. Over thirty years
before, he had in Congress been a strict constructionist
and an anti-federalist. In 1801 he had
required a candidate desiring his support to be
"an admirer of state authority, agreeable to the
true literal meaning" of the Constitution, and
"banishing the dangerous doctrine of implication."
If he were now to have undivided responsibility,
this old Democratic trend of his would, it was
hoped, be strong enough under Democratic advice.
As a candidate, the inconsistencies of a soldier
politician were far outweighed by his picturesque
and powerful personality. It is commonly thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of Jackson that he was a headstrong, passionate,
illiterate man, used and pulled about by a few intriguers.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
He was himself a politician of a high order. His
letters are full of shrewd, vigorous, and even managing
suggestions of partisan man&#339;uvres. Their
political utterances show a highly active and generally
sensible though not disciplined mind. He
had had long and important experience of civil
affairs, in the lower house of Congress, in the federal
Senate when he was only thirty years old, in
the constitutional convention of his State, in its
Supreme Court, later again in the Senate; he had
been for eight years before the country as a candidate
for its first office, and for many years in
public business of large importance. There were
two of the most distinguished Americans, men of
the ripest abilities and amplest experience, and far
removed from rashness, who from 1824 or before
had steadily preferred Jackson for the presidency.
These were Edward Livingston of Louisiana and
De Witt Clinton of New York. Daniel Webster
described his manners as "more presidential than
those of any of the candidates." Jackson was, he
wrote, "grave, mild, and reserved." Unless in
Jackson's case there were effects without adequate
causes, it is very certain that, with faults of most
serious character, he still had the ability, the dignity,
and the wisdom of a ruler of a high rank.
He was, as very few men are, born to rule.</p>

<p>After Crawford's defeat, Van Buren is credited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
with a skillful management of the alliance of his
forces with those of Jackson. There is not yet
public, if it exist, any original evidence as to the
details of this work. Van Buren's enemies were
fond of describing it as full of cunning and trickery,
the work of "the little magician;" and later
and fairer writers have adopted from these enemies
this characterization. But all this seems entirely
without proof. Nor is the story probable. The
union of the Crawford and Jackson men was perfectly
natural. Crawford was a physical wreck,
out of public life. Numerous as were the exceptions,
his followers and Jackson's included the
great majority of the strict constructionists; and
but a minority of either of the two bodies held the
opposite views. Neither of the two men had, at
the last election, been defeated by the other. That
Van Buren used at Washington his unrivaled skill
in assuaging animosities and composing differences
there can be no doubt. After the end of the session
in March, 1827, together with Churchill C.
Cambreleng, a member of Congress from New
York and a close political friend of his, he made
upon this mission a tour through Virginia, the Carolinas,
and Georgia. They visited Crawford, and
were authorized to declare that he should support
Jackson, but did not wish to aid Calhoun. At
Raleigh Van Buren told the citizens that the spirit
of encroachment had assumed a new and far more
seductive aspect, and could only be resisted by the
exercise of uncommon virtues. Passing through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Washington on his way north, he paid a polite
visit to Adams, talking with him placidly about
Rufus King, Monroe, and the Petersburg horse-races.
The President, regarding him as "the
great electioneering manager for General Jackson,"
promptly noted in his diary, when the interview
was over, that Van Buren was now acting the
part Burr had performed in 1799 and 1800; and
he found "much resemblance of character, manners,
and even person, between the two men."</p>

<p>As early as 1826 the Van Buren Republicans of
New York, and an important part of the Clintonians
with the great governor at their head, had
determined to support Jackson. Van Buren is
said to have concealed his attitude until after his
re&euml;lection to the Senate in 1827. But this is a
complete error, except as to his public choice of
a candidate. His opposition to the Adams-Clay
administration, it has already appeared, had been
outspoken from 1825. The Jackson candidacy was
not indeed definitely announced in New York until
1827. The cry for "Old Hickory" then went
up with a sudden unanimity which seemed to the
Adams men a bit of devilish magic, but which was
the patient prearrangement of a skillful politician
appreciating his responsibility, and waiting, as the
greatest of living politicians<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> recently told England
a statesman ought to wait, until the time was
really ripe, until the popular inclination was sufficiently
formed to justify action by men in responsible
public station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The opposition to the re&euml;lection of John Quincy
Adams in 1828 was sincerely considered by him,
and has been often described by others, as singularly
causeless, unworthy, and even monstrous.
But in truth it led to one of the most necessary,
one of the truest, political revolutions which our
country has known. Both Adams and Clay were
positive and able men. They were resolute that
the rather tepid democracy of Monroe should be
succeeded by a highly national, a federally active
administration. Prior to the election of 1824 Clay
had been as nearly in opposition as the era of good
feeling permitted. Early in Monroe's administration
he had attacked the President's declaration
that Congress had no right to construct roads and
canals. His criticism, Mr. Schurz tells us in his
brilliant and impartial account of the time, "had
a strong flavor of bitterness in it;" it was in part
made up of "oratorical flings," by which Clay unnecessarily
sought to attack and humiliate Monroe.
Adams's diary states Clay's opposition to have
been "violent, systematic," his course to have been
"angry, acrimonious." Late in 1819 Monroe's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
friends had even consulted over the wisdom of defeating
Clay's re&euml;lection to the speakership; and
still later Clay had, as Mr. Schurz says, fiercely
castigated the administration for truckling to foreigners.
When Clay came into power, it would
have been unreasonable for him to suppose that
there must not arise vigorous parliamentary opposition
on the part of those who consider themselves
the true Republican successors of Monroe, seeking
to stop the diversion into strange ways which Clay
and Adams had now begun. Richard Rush of
Pennsylvania, Adams's secretary of the treasury,
and now the Adams candidate for vice-president,
had, in one of his annual reports, declared it to be
the duty of government "to augment the number
and variety of occupations for its inhabitants; to
hold out to every degree of labor, and to every
modification of skill, its appropriate object and inducement;
to organize the whole labor of a country;
to entice into the widest ranges its mechanical
and intellectual capacities, instead of suffering
them to slumber; to call forth, wherever hidden,
latent ingenuity, giving to effort activity and to
emulation ardor; to create employment for the
greater amount of numbers by adapting it to the
diversified faculties, propensities, and situations of
men, so that every particle of ability, every shade
of genius, may come into requisition." Nor did
this glowing picture of a useful and beneficent
government go far beyond the utterances of Rush's
senior associate on the presidential ticket. It is
certain that it was highly agreeable to Clay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely there could be no clearer political issue
presented, on the one side by Van Buren's speeches
in the Senate, and on the other by authoritative
and solemn declarations of the three chief persons
of the administration. Whatever the better side
of the issue may have been, no issue was ever a
more legitimate subject of a political campaign.
It is true that the accusations were unfounded,
which were directed against Adams for treachery
to the Republican principles he professed after, on
adhering to Jefferson, he had resigned his seat in
the Senate. He had joined Jefferson on questions
of foreign policy and domestic defense, and had,
until his election to the presidency, been chiefly
concerned with diplomacy. But though the accusations
were false, it is true enough that Adams
himself had made the issue of the campaign. Nor
was it creditable to him that he saw in the opposition
something merely personal to himself. If
he were wrong upon the issue, as Van Buren and
a majority of the people thought, his long public
service, his utter integrity, his exalted sense of the
obligations of office, ought not to have saved him
from the battle or from defeat. How true and
deep was this political contest of 1828 one sees in
the fact that from it, almost as much as from the
triumph of Jefferson, flow the traditions of one of
the great American parties, traditions which survived
the corruptions of slavery, and are still powerful
in party administration.<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> If John Quincy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Adams had been elected, and if, as might naturally
have been the case, there had followed, at this commencement
of railway building, a firm establishment
of the doctrine that the national government
could properly build roads within the States, it is
more than mere speculation to say that the later
history of the United States would, whether for
the better or the worse, have been very different
from what it has been. The dangers to which
American institutions would be exposed, if the
federal government had become a great power
levying taxes upon the whole country to be used
in constructing railways, or, what was worse, purchasing
stock in railway corporations, and doing
this, as it would inevitably have done, according
to the amount of pressure here or there,&mdash;such
dangers, it is easy to understand, seem, whether
rightly or wrongly, appalling to a large class of
political thinkers. To realize this sense of danger
dissipates the aspect of <i>doctrinaire</i> extravagance
in the speeches of Adams's opponents against latitudinarian
construction.</p>

<p>In the canvass of 1828 there was on both sides
more wicked and despicable exhibition of slander
than had been known since Jefferson and John
Adams were pitted against each other. Jackson
was a military butcher and utterly illiterate; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
chastity of his wife was doubtful. Adams had
corruptly bargained away offices; his accounts of
public moneys received by him needed serious
scrutiny; and, that the charges might be precisely
balanced, he had when minister at St. Petersburg
acted as procurer to the Czar of Russia. These
lies doubtless defeated themselves; but in each
election since 1828 there have been politicians
low enough and silly enough to imitate them. To
nothing of this kind did Van Buren descend. Nor
does it seem that even then he used the cry of a
corrupt bargain between Adams and Clay, in which
Jackson believed as long as he lived. The coalition
of 1825, defeating, as it had, a candidate chosen by
a larger number of voters than any other, was the
most used, and probably the most successfully
used, of any of the campaign issues. Nor was this
clearly illegitimate, although Adams and many for
him have hotly condemned its immorality. Every
political coalition between men lately in opposition
political and personal, by which both get office, is
fairly open to criticism. In experience it has always
been full of political danger, although since
the prejudice of the times has worn away, the defense
of Adams and Clay is seen to be amply sufficient.
Whatever had been their mutual dislikes
political or personal, each of them was politically
and in his practical statesmanship far nearer to the
other than to any other of the competitors. But
we have yet to see a political campaign against a
coalition whose members have been rewarded with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
office, in which this form of attack is not made
by men very intelligent and most honest. Nor is
there any reason to hold the followers of Jackson
to a higher standard. In our own time we have
seen two coalitions whose parties wisely recognized
this danger. The chief leaders of the Republican
revolt in 1884 neither sought nor took office from
the former adversaries with whom for once they
then acted. The Dissenting Liberals in England
did not take office in the Conservative ministry
formed in 1886; and the odium which, in the
change later made in it, followed Mr. Goschen into
its second place, illustrated very well the truth
that, however honorable the course may be, it is
inevitably dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Nor can moral condemnation be passed upon the
use in 1828 of the defeat in 1824, of the candidate
having the largest popular vote. We see pretty
clearly in a constitutionally governed country that
when power is lawfully lodged with a public man,
he must act upon his own judgment; and that, if
he be influenced by others, then he ought to be influenced
by the wishes and interests of those who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>supported him, and not of those who opposed him,
even though far more numerous than his supporters.
Repeatedly have we seen a state legislature,
which the arrangement of districts has caused
to be elected from a party in minority in the whole
State, choose a federal senator who it was known
would have been defeated upon a popular vote; and
this without criticism of the conduct of the legislators,
but only of the defective district division. In
Connecticut it has happened more than once that,
neither candidate for governor having a majority
vote, the legislature has chosen a candidate having
one of the smaller minorities; and here again without
criticism of the legislature's morality. But still
the general rule of American elections is, that the
candidate shall be chosen who is preferred by more
votes than any other. To assent to a constitutional
defeat of such a preference, but afterwards and
under the law to make strong appeal to right the
wrong which the law has wrought, seems a highly
defensible course, and to deserve little of the criticism
visited upon the Jackson canvass of 1828. If
party divisions be justifiable, if chief public officers
are to be chosen for their views on great questions
of state, if the cold appeals of political reasoning
are ever rightly strengthened by appeals to popular
feelings, the campaign which Van Buren and his
associates began in 1825 or 1826 was perfectly
justifiable. Nor in its result can any one deny,
whether it were for better or worse, that their success
in the battle worked a change in the principles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of administration, and not a mere vulgar driving
from office of one body of men that another might
take their places.</p>

<p>The death of De Witt Clinton left Van Buren
easily the largest figure in public life, as he had for
several years been the most powerful politician, in
New York State. The gossip that the most important
place in Jackson's cabinet was really allotted
to him before the election of 1828 is probably
true. But, whether true or not, there was, apart
from a natural desire to administer the first office
in his State, obvious advantage to his political
prestige in passing successfully through a popular
election. The most cynical of managing politicians
recognize the enormous strength of a man
for whom the people have actually shown that they
like to vote. Van Buren may have counted besides
upon the advantage which Jackson's personal
popularity brought to those in his open alliance,
although Adams was known still to have, as
the election showed he had, considerable Democratic
strength. Van Buren took therefore the
Bucktail nomination for governor of New York.
The National Republicans, as the Adams men were
called, nominated Smith Thompson, a judge of the
federal Supreme Court. Van Buren got 136,794
and Thompson 106,444 votes. But in spite of so
large a plurality Van Buren did not quite have a
majority of the popular vote. Solomon Southwick,
the anti-Masonic candidate, received 33,345 votes.
It was the first election after this extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
movement. The abduction of Morgan and his
probable murder to prevent his revelation of Masonic
secrets had occurred in the fall of 1826.
The criminal trials consequent upon it had caused
intense excitement; and a political issue was easily
made, for many distinguished men of both parties
were members of that secret order. How powerful
for a time may be a popular cry, though based
upon an utterly absurd issue, became more obvious
still later when electoral votes for president were
cast for William Wirt, the anti-Masonic candidate;
and when John Quincy Adams, after graduating
from the widest experience in public affairs of any
American of his generation, was, as he himself records,
willing to accept, and when William H.
Seward was willing to tender him, a presidential
nomination of the anti-Masonic party. As Southwick's
preposterous vote was in 1828 drawn from
both parties, Van Buren's prestige, although he
had but a plurality vote, was increased by his victory
at the polls. Jackson very truly said in February,
1832, that it was now "the general wish and
expectation of the Republican party throughout
the Union" that Van Buren should take the place
next to the President in the national administration.
Jackson was himself elected by a very great
popular and electoral majority. In New York,
where on this single occasion the electors were
chosen in districts, and where the anti-Masonic vote
was cast against Jackson who held high rank in
the Masonic order, Adams secured 16 votes to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Jackson's 18; but to the latter were added the two
electors chosen by the thirty-four district electors.</p>

<p>Van Buren's career as governor was very brief.
He was inaugurated on January 1, 1829, and at
once resigned his seat in the federal Senate. On
March 12th of the same year he resigned the governor's
seat. His inaugural message is said by
Hammond, the political historian of New York, by
no means too friendly to Van Buren, to have been
"the best executive message ever communicated to
the legislature;" and after nearly sixty years, it
seems, in the leather-covered tome containing it, a
remarkably clear, wise, and courageous paper. The
excitement over internal improvements in communication
was then at its height. He declared that,
whatever difference there might be as to whether
such improvements ought to be undertaken by the
federal government or by the States, none seriously
doubted that it was wise to apply portions of the
means of New York to such improvements. The
investment of the State in the Delaware and Hudson
canal, then just completed, had, he thought,
been "crowned with the most cheering success."
Splendid, too, as had been the success of the Erie
and Champlain canals, it was still clear that all
had not been equally benefited. The friends of
the state road and of the Chemung and Chenango
canals had urged him to recommend for them a
legislative support. But it was a time, he said,
for "the utmost prudence and circumspection"
upon that "delicate and vitally interesting subject."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The banking question, he told the legislature,
would make the important business of its session.
It turned out besides to be one of the important
businesses of Van Buren's career. To meet the
attacks upon him for having once been interested
in a bank, he dexterously recited that, "having
for many years ceased to have an interest in those
institutions and declined any agency in their management,"
he was conscious of his imperfect information.
But he could not ignore a matter of
such magnitude to their constituents. The whole
bank agitation at this time showed the difficulties
and scandals caused by the absence of a free banking
system, and by the long accustomed grants of
exclusive banking charters. Of the forty banks in
the State, all specially incorporated, the charters of
thirty-one would expire within one, two, three, or
four years. Their actual capital was $15,000,000;
their outstanding loans, more than $30,000,000.
Van Buren urged, therefore, the legislature now to
make by general law final disposition of the whole
subject. The abolition of banks had, he said, no
advocate, and a dependence solely upon those established
by federal authority deserved none; but
he rejected the idea of a state bank. "Experience,"
he declared, "has shown that banking
operations, to be successful, and consequently beneficial
to the community, must be conducted by
private men upon their own account." He condemned
the practice by which the State accepted a
money bonus for granting a bank charter, neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>sarily
involving some monopoly. The concern of
the State, he pointed out, should be to make its
banks and their circulation secure; and such security
was impaired, not increased, by encouraging
banks in competition with one another, and "stimulated
by the golden harvest in view," to make large
payments for their charters. He submitted for
legislative consideration the idea of the "safety
fund" communicated to him in an interesting and
intelligent paper by Joshua Forman. Under this
system all the banks of the State, whatever their
condition, were to contribute to a fund to be administered
under state supervision, the fund to be
a security for all dishonored bank-notes. To this
extent all the banks were to insure or indorse the
circulation of each bank, thus saving the scandal
and loss arising from the occasional failure of
banks to redeem their notes, and making every
bank watchful of all its associates. In compelling
the banks to submit to some general scheme, the
representative of the people would indeed, he said,
enter into "conflict with the claims of the great
moneyed interest of the country; but what political
exhibition so truly gratifying as the return to his
constituents of the faithful public servant after
having turned away every approach and put far
from him every sinister consideration!"</p>

<p>Van Buren proposed a separation of state from
national elections; a question still discussed, and
upon each side of which much is to be said. He
attacked the use of money in elections, "the prac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>tice
of employing persons to attend the polls for
compensation, of placing large sums in the hands
of others to entertain the electors," and other devices
by which the most valuable of all our temporal
privileges "was brought into disrepute." If the
expenses of elections should increase as they had
lately done, the time would soon arrive "when a
man in middling circumstances, however virtuous,
will not be able to compete upon anything like
equal terms with a wealthy opponent." In long
advance of a modern agitation for reform which,
lately beginning with us, will, it is to be hoped,
not cease until the abuses are removed, he proposed
a law imposing "severe and enforcible penalties
upon the advance of money by individuals for any
purposes connected with the election except the
single one of printing."</p>

<p>Turning to the field of general politics, he again
declared the political faith to whose support he
wished to rally his party. That "a jealousy of
the exercise of delegated political power, a solicitude
to keep public agents within the precise limits
of their authority, and an assiduous adherence to a
rigid and scrupulous economy, were indications of
a contracted spirit unbecoming the character of a
statesman," he pronounced to be a political heresy,
from which he himself had not been entirely free,
but which ought at once to be exploded. Official
discretion, as a general rule, could not be confided
to any one without danger of abuse. But he reproved
the parsimony which disagreeably charac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>terized
the democracy of the time, and which
inadequately paid great public servants like the
chancellor and judges. In the tendency of the
federal government to encroach upon the States
lay, he thought, the danger of the federal Constitution.
But of the disposition and capacity of the
American people to resist such encroachments as
our political history recorded, there were, he said,
without naming either Adams, "two prominent
and illustrious instances." As long as that good
spirit was preserved, the republic would be safe;
and for that preservation every patriot ought to
pray.</p>

<p>The reputation of the country had in some degree
suffered, he said, from "the uncharitable and
unrelenting scrutiny to which private as well as
public character" had been subjected in the late
election. But this injury had been "relieved, if
not removed, by seeing how soon the overflowing
waters of bitterness" had spent themselves, and
"that already the current of public feeling had
resumed its accustomed channels." These excesses
were the price paid for the full enjoyment of the
right of opinion. With an assertion of "perfect
deference to that sacred privilege, and in the humble
exercise of that portion of it" which belonged
to him, and of a sincere desire not to offend the
feelings of those who differed from him, he ended
his message by congratulating the legislature upon
the election of Jackson and Calhoun. This result,
he said in words not altogether insincere or untrue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
but full of the unfairness of partisan dispute, infused
fresh vigor into the American political system,
refuted the odious imputation that republics
are ungrateful, dissipated the vain hope that our
citizens could be influenced by aught save appeals
to their understanding and love of country, and
finally exhibited in "bold relief the omnipotence
of public opinion, and the futility of all attempts
to overawe it by the denunciation of power, or to
reduce it by the allurements of patronage."</p>

<p>Among the Hoyt letters, afterwards published
by Van Buren's rancorous enemy, Mackenzie, are
two letters of his upon his patronage as governor.
It is not unfair to suppose that he wrote many
other letters like them, and they give a useful
glimpse of the distribution of offices at Albany
sixty years ago. These letters to Hoyt were of the
most confidential character, and showed a strong but
not uncontrolled desire to please party friends and
to meet party expectations. But in none of them is
there a suggestion of anything dishonorable. He
asked, "When will the Republican party be made
sensible of the indispensable necessity of nominating
none but true and tried men, so that when
they succeed they gain something?" He was unable
to oblige his "good friend Coddington ... in
relation to the health appointments." Dr. Westervelt's
claims were "decidedly the strongest; and
much was due to the relations in which he stood to
Governor Tompkins, especially from one who knew
so well what the latter has done and suffered for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
this State." He wrote of Marcy, whom he appointed
a judge of the supreme court, that he "was
so situated that I must make him a judge or ruin
him." All this is doubtless not unlike what the
best of public officers have sometimes said and
thought, though rarely written; and, like most talk
over patronage, it is not in very exalted tone. But
if Van Buren admitted as one of Westervelt's
claims to public office that he was of a Whig family
and a Democrat "from his cradle," he found
among his other claims that he was "a gentleman
and a man of talent," and had been "three years
in the hospital and five years deputy health officer,
until he was cruelly removed." Dr. Manley he
refused to remove from the health office, because
"his extraordinary capacity is universally admitted;"
and pointed out that the removal "could
only be placed on political grounds, and as he was
a zealous Jackson man at the last election, that
could not have been done without danger." "I
should not," he said, however, "have given Manley
the office originally, if I could have found a competent
Republican to take it." William L. Marcy,
whom he made judge, was already known as one of
the ablest men in the State, and his appointment
was admirable, though his salvation from ruin, if
Van Buren was speaking seriously, was not a
public end fit to be served by high judicial appointment.
John C. Spencer, one of the best lawyers
of New York, was appointed by Van Buren
special counsel for the prosecution of Morgan's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
murderers. Hammond wondered "how so rigid a
party man as Mr. Van Buren was, came to appoint
a political opponent to so important an office," but
concluded that it was a fine specimen of his peculiar
tact, because Spencer, though a man of talents
and great moral courage, might be defeated in the
prosecution, and thus be injured with the anti-Masons;
while if he succeeded, his vigor and fidelity
would draw upon him Masonic hostility. But
the simpler explanation is the more probable. Van
Buren desired to adhere in this, as he did in most
of his appointments, to a high standard. Upon
this particular appointment his own motives might
be distrusted; and he therefore went to the ranks
of his adversaries for one of their most distinguished
and invulnerable leaders. Van Buren was
long condemned as a "spoils" politician; but he
was not accused of appointing either incompetent
or dishonest men to office. In the great place of
governor he must have already begun to see how
difficult and dangerous was this power of patronage.
It must be fairly admitted that he pretty
carefully limited, by the integrity and efficiency of
the public service, the political use which he made
of his appointments,&mdash;a use made in varying degrees
by every American holding important executive
power from the first Adams to our own time.</p>

<p>On March 12, 1829, Governor Van Buren resigned
his office with the hearty and unanimous
approval of his party friends, whom he gathered
together on receiving Jackson's invitation to Wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>ington.
He was in their hands, he said, and should
abide by their decision. Both houses of the legislature
passed congratulatory and even affectionate
resolutions; and his brief and brilliant career in
the executive chamber of the State ended happily,
as does any career which ends that a seemingly
greater one may begin.</p>

<span class="ft80">SECRETARY OF STATE.&mdash;DEFINITE FORMATION OF
THE DEMOCRATIC CREED</span></h2>


<p>Van Buren was appointed secretary of state on
March 5, 1829; but did not reach Washington
until the 22d, and did not act as secretary until
April 4. James A. Hamilton, a son of Alexander
Hamilton, but then an influential Jackson man,
was acting secretary in the meantime. The two
years of Van Buren's administration of this office
are perhaps the most picturesque years of American
political history. The Eaton scandal; the
downfall of Calhoun's political power; the magical
success of Van Buren; the "kitchen cabinet;" the
odious removals from office, and the outcries of
the removed; the fiery passion of Jackson; the
horror both real and affected of the opposition,&mdash;all
these have been an inexhaustible quarry to historical
writers. Until very recently the larger use
has been made of the material derived from hostile
sources; and it has seemed easy to paint pictures of
this really important time in the crudest and highest
colors of dislike. The American democracy,
at last let loose, driven by Jackson with a sort of
demoniac energy and cunningly used by Van Buren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
for his own selfish and even Mephistophelian ends,
is supposed to have broken from every sound and
conservative principle. Perhaps for no other period
in our history has irresponsible and unverified campaign
literature of the time so largely become authority
to serious writers; and for no other period
does truth more strongly require a judgment upon
well established results rather than upon partisan
rumor and gossip. During these years there was
definitely and practically formed, under the auspices
of Jackson's administration, a political creed,
a body of principles or tendencies in politics which
have ever since strongly held the American people.
Some of them have become established by a universal
acquiescence. During the same years there
began an extension into federal politics of the
"spoils system," which has been an evil second
only to slavery, and from which we are only now
recovering. To Van Buren more than to any man
of his time must be awarded the credit of forming
the creed of the Jacksonian Democracy. And in
the shame of the abuse, which has so greatly tended
to neutralize the soundest articles of political faith,
Van Buren must participate with other and inferior
men of his own time, and with the very greatest of
the men who followed him. In this narrative it is
impossible to ignore some of the petty and undignified
details which characterized the time,&mdash;details
from part of the discredit of which Van Buren
cannot escape. But it would lead to gross error
to let such details obscure the vital and lasting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
political work of the highest order in which Van
Buren was a central and controlling power.</p>

<p>Besides Van Buren, Jackson's cabinet included
Ingham of Pennsylvania in the Treasury, Eaton
in the War Department, Branch in the Navy, Berrien
of Georgia attorney-general, and Barry of
Kentucky in the Post-Office, succeeding McLean,
who after a short service was appointed to the
Supreme Court. Eaton, Branch, and Berrien had
been federal senators, the first chiefly commended
by Jackson's strong personal liking for him. Ingham,
Branch, and Berrien represented, or were
supposed to represent, the Calhoun influence. Van
Buren in ability and reputation easily stood head
and shoulders above his associates. When he left
Albany for Washington he was believed to have
done more than any one else to secure the Republican
triumph; and if Webster's recollections
twenty years later were correct, he did more to
prevent "Mr. Adams's re&euml;lection in 1828, and to
obtain General Jackson's election, than any other
man&mdash;yes, than any ten other men&mdash;in the country."
He was the first politician in the party;
Calhoun and he were its most distinguished statesmen.
Already the succession after Jackson belonged
to one of them, the only doubt being to
which; and in that doubt was stored up a long and
complicated feud. The rivalry between these two
great men was inevitable; it was not dishonorable
to either. Calhoun's fame was the older; he was
already one of the junior candidates for the presi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>dency,
popular in Pennsylvania and even in New
England, when Van Buren was hardly known out
of New York. In 1829 he had been chosen vice-president
for the second time. He had shown talents
of a very high order. But he had now suffered
some years from the presidential fever which distorts
the vision, and which, when popularity wanes,
becomes heavy with enervating melancholy. He
was an able doctrinaire, but narrow and dogmatic.
The jealous and ravenous temper of the rich slaveholders
of South Carolina already possessed him.
He was a Southern man; and all the presidents
thus far, except the elder and younger Adams,
had been Southerners. In 1824 he had stood indifferent
between Jackson and Adams, and in Jackson's
final triumph had borne no decisive part.
Van Buren's wider, richer, and more constructive
mind, his superior political judgment, his mellower
personality, his practical skill in affairs, sufficiently
explain his victory over Calhoun, without resort to
the bitter rumors of tricks and magical man&#339;uvres
spread by Calhoun's and Clay's friends, and which,
though without authentic corroboration, have to
our own day been widely accepted.</p>

<p>Before Jackson's inauguration, Calhoun sought
to prevent Van Buren's selection for the State Department.
He told the general that Tazewell of
Virginia ought to be appointed. New York, he
said, would have been secured by Clinton if he
had lived; but now New York needed no appointment.
Jackson listened coldly to the plainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
jealous appeal; and James A. Hamilton, who was at
the time on intimate terms with Jackson, supposed
it to be Calhoun's last interview with Jackson
about the cabinet. Van Buren had been Jackson's
choice a year ago; and to all the reasons which
had then existed were now added his great services
in the canvass, and the prestige of his popular
election as governor.</p>

<p>The episode of Mrs. Eaton, the wife of the new
secretary of war, was absurd enough in a constitutionally
governed country; but this silly "court
scandal," which might very well have enlivened
the pages of a secretary of a privy council or an
ambassador from a petty German prince, did no
more than hasten the inevitable division. In the
hastening, however, Van Buren doubtless reaped
some profit in Jackson's greater friendship. Many
respectable people in Washington believed that
unchastity on the part of this lady had induced
her former husband, Timberlake, to cut his throat.
Her second marriage to Eaton had just taken
place in January, 1829, after Jackson, learning
of the scandal but disbelieving it, had said to
Eaton, "Your marrying her will disprove these
charges, and restore Peg's good name." The general
treated with violent contempt the persons,
some of them clergymen, "whose morbid appetite,"
he wrote the Rev. Dr. Ely on March 23, 1829,
"delights in defamation and slander." Burning
with anger at those who had dared in the recent
canvass to malign his own wife now dead, he de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>fended
with chivalrous resolution the lady whom
his own wife "to the last moment of her life believed ... to
be an innocent and much-injured
woman." Even Mrs. Madison, he said, "was assailed
by these fiends in human shape." When
protests were made against Eaton's appointment
to the cabinet, Jackson savagely cried, "I will
sink or swim with him, by God!" All this had
happened before Van Buren reached Washington.
There then followed the grave question, whether
Mrs. Eaton should be adjudged guilty by society
and sentenced to exclusion from its ceremonious
enjoyments. The ladies generally were determined
against her, even the ladies of Jackson's own household.
Jackson proposed the task, impossible even
to an emperor, of compelling recognition of this
distressed and persecuted consort of a minister of
state. The unfortunate married men in the cabinet
were in embarrassment indeed. They would not
if they could, so they said,&mdash;or at least they could
not if they would,&mdash;induce their wives to visit
or receive visits from the wife of their colleague.
Jackson showed them very clearly that no other
course would satisfy him. Calhoun in his matrimonial
state was at the same disadvantage. Even
foreign ministers and their wives met the President's
displeasure for not properly treating the
wife of the American secretary of war.</p>

<p>When Van Buren entered this farcical scene, his
widowed condition, and the fortune of having sons
rather than daughters, left him quite unembar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>rassed.
He politely called upon his associate's
wife, as he called upon the others; he treated her
with entire deference of manner. It is probable,
though by no means clear, for popular feeling
was supposed to run high in sacred defense of the
American home, that this was the more politic
course. It is now, however, certain that by doing
so he gave to Jackson, and some who were personally
very close to Jackson, more gratification than
he gave offense elsewhere; and this has been the
occasion of much aspersion of Van Buren's motives.
But whether his course were politic or not, it is
easy enough to see that any other course would
have been inexcusable. It would have been dastardly
in the extreme for Van Buren, reaching
Washington and finding a controversy raging
whether or not the wife of one of his associates
were virtuous, to pronounce her guilty, as he most
unmistakably would have done had he refused her
the attention which etiquette required him to pay
all ladies in her position. Parton in his Life of
Jackson quotes from an anonymous Washington
correspondent, whose account he says was "exaggerated
and prejudiced but not wholly incorrect,"
the story that Van Buren induced the British and
Russian ministers, both of whom to their immediate
peace of mind happened to be bachelors, to treat
Mrs. Eaton with distinction at their entertainments.
But the supposition seems quite gratuitous.
Neither of those unmarried diplomats was likely to
do so absurdly indefensible a thing as to insult by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
marked exclusion a cabinet minister's wife, whom
the President for any reason, good or bad, treated
with special distinction and respect. Van Buren's
common sense was a strong characteristic; and he
doubtless looked upon the whole affair with amused
contempt. As the cabinet officer who had most
to do with social ceremonies, he may well have
sought to calm the irritation and establish for Mrs.
Eaton, where he could, the usual forms of civility.
Like many other blessings of etiquette, these forms
permit one to hold unoffending neutrality upon the
moral deserts of persons whom he meets. It happened
that Calhoun's friends had tried to prevent
Eaton's appointment to the War Department, and
afterwards sought to remove him from the cabinet.
The episode added, therefore, keen edge to the
growing hostility of Jackson and his near friends
to Calhoun, and thus tended to strengthen his
rival. But all this would have signified little but
for something deeper and broader. The preference
of Van Buren had been dictated by powerful causes
long before Mrs. Timberlake became Mrs. Eaton.
These causes now grew more and more powerful.</p>

<p>Calhoun was serving his second term as Vice-President.
A third term for that office was obnoxious
to the rule already established for the
presidency. Calhoun therefore desired Jackson
to be content with one term; for if he took a
second, Calhoun feared, and with good reason, that
he himself, being then out of the vice-presidency,
and so no longer in sight on that conspicuous seat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of preparation, might fall dangerously out of mind.
So it was soon known that Calhoun's friends were
opposed to a second term for Jackson. At a Pennsylvania
meeting on March 31, 1830, the opposition
was openly made. Before this, and quite apart
from Jackson's natural hostility to the nullification
theory which had arisen in Calhoun's State, he had
conceived a strong dislike for Calhoun for a personal
reason. With this Van Buren had nothing
whatever to do, so far as appears from any evidence
better than the uncorroborated rumors which
ascribe to Van Buren's magic every incident which
injured Calhoun's standing with Jackson. Years
before, Monroe's cabinet had discussed the treatment
due Jackson for his extreme measures in
the Seminole war. Calhoun, then secretary of
war, had favored a military trial of the victorious
general; but John Quincy Adams and Monroe
had defended him, as did also Crawford, the secretary
of the treasury. For a long while Jackson
had erroneously supposed that Calhoun was
the only member of the cabinet in his favor;
and Calhoun had not undeceived him. Some time
before Jackson's election, Hamilton had visited
Crawford to promote the desired reconciliation
between him and the general; and a letter was
written by Governor Forsyth of Georgia to Hamilton,
quoting Crawford's explanation of the real
transactions in Monroe's cabinet. Jackson was
ignorant of all this until a dinner given by him in
honor of Monroe in November, 1829. Ringold, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
personal friend of Monroe's, in a complimentary
speech at seeing Jackson and Monroe seated together,
said to William B. Lewis that Monroe had
been "the only one of his cabinet" friendly to
Jackson in the Seminole controversy; and after
dinner the remark, after being discussed between
Lewis and Eaton the secretary of war, was repeated
by the latter to Jackson, who said he must be
mistaken. Lewis then told Jackson of Forsyth's
letter, which greatly excited him, already disliking
Calhoun as he did, and not unnaturally susceptible
about his reputation in a war which had been the
subject of violent and even savage attacks upon
him in the recent canvass. Jackson sent at once
to New York for the letter. But Hamilton was
unwilling to give it without Forsyth's permission;
and when Forsyth, on the assembling of Congress,
was consulted, he preferred that Crawford should
be directly asked for the information. This was
done, and Crawford wrote an account which in
May, 1830, Jackson sent to Calhoun with a demand
for an explanation. Calhoun admitted that he had,
after hearing of the seizure of the Spanish forts in
Florida and Jackson's execution of the Englishmen
Arbuthnot and Ambrister, expressed an opinion
against him, and proposed an investigation of his
conduct by a court of inquiry. He further told
Jackson, with much dignity of manner, that the
latter was being used in a plot to effect Calhoun's
political extinction and the exaltation of his enemies.
The President received Calhoun's letter on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
his way to church, and upon his return from religious
meditation wrote to the Vice-President that
"motives are to be inferred from actions and
judged by our God;" that he had long repelled
the insinuations that it was Calhoun, and not
Crawford, who had secretly endeavored to destroy
his reputation; that he had never expected to say
to Calhoun, "<i>Et tu, Brute!</i>" and that there need
be no further communication on the subject.
Thus was finally established the breach between
Calhoun and Jackson, which this personal matter
had widened but had by no means begun. In none
of it did Van Buren have any part. When Jackson
sent Lewis to him with Calhoun's letter and
asked his opinion, he refused to read it, saying
that an attempt would undoubtedly be made to
hold him responsible for the rupture, and he wished
to be able to say that he knew nothing of it. This
course was doubtless politic, and deserves no applause;
but it was also simply right. On getting
this message Jackson said, "I reckon Van is right;
I dare say they will attempt to throw the whole
blame on him."</p>

<p>A few weeks before, on April 13, 1830, the
dinner to celebrate Jefferson's birthday was held
at Washington. It was attended by the President
and Vice-President, the cabinet officers, and many
other distinguished persons. There were reports
at the time that it was intended to use Jefferson's
name in support of the state-rights doctrines, and
against internal improvements and a protective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
tariff. This shows how clearly were already recognized
some of the great causes underlying the
political movements and personal differences of the
time. The splendid parliamentary encounter between
Hayne and Webster had taken place but
two or three months before. In his speech Hayne,
who was understood, as Benton tells us, to give
voice to the sentiments of Calhoun, had plainly
enough stated the doctrine of nullification. Jackson
at the dinner robustly confronted the extremists
with his famous toast, "Our federal Union: it
must be preserved." Calhoun, already conscious
of his leadership in a sectional controversy, followed
with the sentiment, true indeed, but said in
words very sinister at that time: "The Union:
next to our liberty the most dear. May we all remember
that it can only be preserved by respecting
the rights of the States, and distributing equally
the benefit and burden of the Union." The secretary
of state next rose with a toast with little ring
or inspiration in it, but plainly, though in conciliatory
phrase, declaring for the Union. He asked
the company to drink, "Mutual forbearance and
reciprocal concessions: through their agency the
Union was established. The patriotic spirit from
which they emanated will forever sustain it."</p>

<p>Van Buren was now definitely a candidate for
the succession. His Northern birth and residence,
his able leadership in Congress of the opposition
to the Adams administration, his almost supreme
political power in the first State of the Union, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
clear and systematic exposition of an intelligible
and timely political creed, the support his friends
gave to Jackson's re&euml;lection,&mdash;all these advantages
were now re&euml;nforced by the tendency to disunion
clear in the utterances from South Carolina, by
Calhoun's efforts to exclude Van Buren and Eaton
from the cabinet, by the hostility to Mrs. Eaton of
the ladies in the households of Calhoun and of his
friends in the cabinet, and now by Jackson's discovery
that, at a critical moment of his career ten
years before, Calhoun had sought his destruction.
Here was a singular union of really sound reasons
why Van Buren should be preferred by his party
and by the country for the succession over Calhoun,
with the strongest reasons why Jackson, and
those close to him, should be in most eager personal
sympathy with the preference. In December,
1829, Jackson had explicitly pronounced in
favor of Van Buren. This was in the letter to
Judge Overton of Tennessee, which Lewis is doubtless
correct in saying he asked Jackson to write
lest the latter should die before his successor was
chosen. Jackson himself drafted the letter, which
Lewis copied with some verbal alteration; and the
letter sincerely expressed his own strong opinions.
After alluding to the harmony between Van Buren
and his associates in the War and Post-Office Departments,
he said: "I have found him everything
that I could desire him to be, and believe him not
only deserving my confidence, but the confidence
of the nation. Instead of his being selfish and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
intriguing, as has been represented by some of his
opponents, I have ever found him frank, open,
candid, and manly. As a counselor, he is able
and prudent, republican in his principles, and one
of the most pleasant men to do business with I
ever knew. He, my dear friend, is well qualified
to fill the highest office in the gift of the people,
who in him will find a true friend and safe depositary
of their rights and liberty. I wish I could
say as much for Mr. Calhoun and some of his
friends." He criticised Calhoun for his silence
on the bank question, for his encouragement of
the resolution in the South Carolina legislature
relative to the tariff, and for his objection to the
apportionment of the surplus revenues after the
national debt should be paid. Jackson had not
yet definitely learned from Forsyth's letter about
Calhoun's attitude in Monroe's cabinet; but his
well-aroused suspicion doubtless influenced his expression.
His strong personal liking for the secretary
of state had been evident from the beginning
of the administration. In a letter to Jesse Hoyt
of April 13, 1829, the latter wrote that he had
found the President affectionate, confidential, and
kind to the last degree, and that he believed there
was no degree of good feeling or confidence which
the president did not entertain for him. In July
he wrote to Hamilton: "The general grows upon
me every day. I can fairly say that I have become
quite enamored with him."</p>

<p>The break between Calhoun and Jackson was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
kept from the public until early in 1831. In the
preceding winter, Duff Green, the editor of the
"Telegraph," until then the administration newspaper,
but still entirely committed to Calhoun,
sought to have the publication of the Calhoun-Jackson
correspondence accompanied by a general
outburst from Republican newspapers against
Jackson. The storm, Benton tells us, was to seem
so universal, and the indignation against Van
Buren so great, that even Jackson's popularity
would not save the prime minister. Jackson's
friends, Barry and Kendall, learning of this, called
to Washington an unknown Kentuckian to be
editor of a new and loyal administration paper.
Francis P. Blair was a singularly astute man, whose
name, and the name of whose family, afterwards
became famous in American politics. He belonged
to the race of advisers of great men, found by
experience to be almost as important in a democracy
as in a monarchy. In February, 1831, Calhoun
openly declared war on Jackson by publishing the
Seminole correspondence. Green having now been
safely re&euml;lected printer to Congress, the "Telegraph,"
according to the plan, strongly supported
Calhoun. The "Globe," Blair's paper, attacked
Calhoun and upheld the President. The importance
in that day ascribed by politicians to the
control of a single newspaper seems curious. In
1823, Van Buren, while a federal senator, was
interested in the "Albany Argus," almost steadily
from that time until the present the ably managed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
organ of the Albany Regency;<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and he then confidentially
wrote to Hoyt: "Without a paper thus
edited at Albany we may hang our harps on the
willows. With it, the party can survive a thousand
such convulsions as those which now agitate and
probably alarm most of those around you." This
seems an astonishingly high estimate of the power
of a paper which, though relatively conspicuous in
the State, could have then had but a small circulation.
It was, however, the judgment of a most
sagacious politician. In 1822 he complained to
Hoyt that his expenses of this description were too
heavy. In 1833 James Gordon Bennett, then a
young journalist of Philadelphia, wrote Hoyt a
plain intimation that money was necessary to enable
him to continue his journalistic warfare in Van
Buren's behalf. Anguish, disappointment, despair,
he said, brooded over him, while Van Buren chose
to sit still and sacrifice those who had supported
him in every weather. Van Buren replied that he
could not directly or indirectly afford pecuniary
aid to Bennett's press, and more particularly as he
was then situated; that if Bennett could not continue
friendly to him on public grounds and with
perfect independence, he could only regret it, but
he desired no other support. He added, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>not to burn his ships behind him, that he had
supposed there would be no difficulty in obtaining
money in New York, if their "friends in Philadelphia
could not all together make out to sustain
one press." Thus was invited a powerful animosity,
vindictively shown even when Van Buren was
within three years of his death.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival Blair entered the famous
Kitchen Cabinet, a singularly talented body, fond
enough indeed of "wire-pulling," but with clear
and steady political convictions. William B. Lewis
had long been a close personal friend of Jackson
and manager of his political interests, and had but
recently earned his gratitude by rushing successfully
to the defense of Mrs. Jackson's reputation.
Kendall and Hill were adroit, industrious, skillful
men; the former afterwards postmaster-general,
and the latter to become a senator from New
Hampshire. Blair entered this company full of
zeal against nullification and the United States
Bank. Jackson himself was so strong-willed a
man, so shrewd in management, so skillful in reading
the public temper, that the story of the complete
domination of this junto over him is quite
absurd. The really great abilities of these men
and their entire devotion to his interests gained a
profound and justifiable influence with him, which
occasional petty or unworthy uses made of it did
not destroy. No one can doubt that Jackson was
confirmed by them in the judgment to which Van
Buren urged him upon great political issues. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
secretary of state refused to give the new paper of
Blair any of the printing of his department, lest
its origin should be attributed to him, and because
he wished to be able to say truly that he
had nothing to do with it. Kendall, who lived
through the civil war, strongly loyal to the Union
and to Jackson's memory, to die a wealthy philanthropist,
declared in his autobiography, and doubtless
correctly, that the "Globe" was not established
by Van Buren or his friends, but by friends of
Jackson who desired his re&euml;lection for another four
years. Nevertheless Van Buren was held responsible
for the paper; and its establishment was soon
followed by the dissolution of the cabinet.</p>

<p>This explosion, it is now clear, was of vast advantage
to the cause of the Union. It took place
in April, 1831, and in part at least was Van Buren's
work. On the 9th of that month he wrote to Edward
Livingston, then a senator from Louisiana
spending the summer at his seat on the Hudson
River, asking him to start for Washington the day
after he received the letter, and to avoid speculation
"by giving out that" he was "going to Philadelphia."
Livingston wrote back from Washington
to his wife that Van Buren had taken the high
and popular ground that, as a candidate for the
presidency, he ought not to remain in the cabinet
when its public measures would be attributed to
his intrigue, and thus made to injure the President;
and that Van Buren's place was pressed upon him
"with all the warmth of friendship and every appeal
to my love of country."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Buren, with courageous skill, put his resignation
to the public distinctly on the ground of his
own political aspiration. On April 11, 1831, he
wrote to the President a letter for publication,
saying that from the moment he had entered the
cabinet it had been his "anxious wish and zealous
endeavor to prevent a premature agitation of the
question" of the succession, "and at all events to
discountenance, and if possible repress, the disposition,
at an early day manifested," to connect
his name "with that disturbing topic." Of "the
sincerity and constancy of his disposition" he appealed
to the President to judge. But he had not
succeeded, and circumstances beyond his control
had given the subject a turn which could not then
"be remedied except by a self-disfranchisement,
which, even if dictated by" his "individual wishes,
could hardly be reconcilable with propriety or
self-respect." In the situation existing at the
time, "diversities of ulterior preference among the
friends of the administration" were unavoidable,
and he added: "Even if the respective advocates of
those thus placed in rivalship be patriotic enough
to resist the temptation of creating obstacles to the
advancement of him to whose elevation they are
opposed, by embarrassing the branch of public
service committed to his charge, they are nevertheless,
by their position, exposed to the suspicion of
entertaining and encouraging such views,&mdash;a suspicion
which can seldom fail, in the end, to aggravate
into present alienation and hostility the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
prospective differences which first gave rise to it."
The public service, he said, required him to remove
such "obstructions" from "the successful prosecution
of public affairs;" and he intimated, with the
affectation of self-depreciation which was disagreeably
fashionable among great men of the day, that
the example he set would, "notwithstanding the
humility of its origin," be found worthy of respect
and observance. When four years later he accepted
the presidential nomination he repeated the
sentiment of this letter, but more explicitly, saying
that his "name was first associated with the question
of General Jackson's successor more through
the ill-will of opponents than the partiality of
friends." This seemed very true. For every movement
which had tended to commit the administration
or its chief against Calhoun or his doctrines,
he had been held responsible as a device to advance
himself. His adversaries had proclaimed him not
so much a public officer as a self-seeking candidate.
It was a rare and true stroke of political genius to
admit his aspiration to the presidency; to deny his
present candidacy and his self-seeking; but, lest
the clamor of his enemies should, if he longer
held his office, throw doubt upon his sincerity, to
withdraw from that station, and to prevent the
continued pretense that he was using official opportunities,
however legitimately, to increase his
public reputation or his political power. Thus
would the candidacy be thrust on him by his enemies.
In his letter he announced that Jackson had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
consented to stand for re&euml;lection; and that, "without
a total disregard of the lights of experience,"
he could not shut his eyes to the unfavorable influence
which his continuance in the cabinet might
have upon Jackson's own canvass in 1832.</p>

<p>In accepting the resignation Jackson declared
the reasons which the letter had presented too
strong to be disregarded, thus practically assenting
to Van Buren's candidacy to succeed him.
Jackson looked with sorrow, he said, upon the
state of things Van Buren had described. But it
was "but an instance of one of the evils to which
free governments must ever be liable," an evil
whose remedy lay "in the intelligence and public
spirit of" their "common constituents," who would
correct it; and in that belief he found "abundant
consolation." He added that, with the best opportunities
for observing and judging, he had seen
in Van Buren no other desire than "to move quietly
on in the path of" his duties, and "to promote
the harmonious conduct of public affairs."
"If on this point," he apostrophized the departing
premier, "you have had to encounter detraction,
it is but another proof of the utter insufficiency
of innocence and worth to shield from such assaults."</p>

<p>Never was a presidential candidate more adroitly
or less dishonorably presented to his party and to
the country. For the adroitness lay in the frank
avowal of a willingness or desire to be president
and a resolution to be a candidate,&mdash;for which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
so far as their conduct went, his adversaries were
really responsible,&mdash;and in seizing an undoubted
opportunity to serve the public. Quite apart from
the sound reason that the secretary of state should
not, if possible, be exposed in dealing with public
questions to aspersions upon his motives, as Van
Buren was quite right in saying that he would be,
it was also clear that the cabinet was inharmonious;
and that its lack of harmony, whatever the
facts or wherever the fault, seriously interfered
with the public business. The administration and
the country, it was obvious, were now approaching
the question of nullification, and upon that question
it was but patriotic to desire that its members
should firmly share the union principles of their
chief. Within a few weeks after the dissolution of
the cabinet, Jackson seized the opportunity afforded
him by an invitation from the city of Charleston to
visit it on the 4th of July, to sound in the ears of
nullification a ringing blast for the Union. If he
could go, he said, he trusted to find in South Carolina
"all the men of talent, exalted patriotism,
and private worth," however divided they might
have been before, "united before the altar of their
country on the day set apart for the solemn celebration
of its independence,&mdash;independence which
cannot exist without union, and with it is eternal."
The disunion sentiments ascribed to distinguished
citizens of the State were, he hoped, if indeed they
were accurately reported, "the effect of momentary
excitement, not deliberate design." For all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
work then performed in defense of the Union,
Jackson and his advisers of the time must share
with Webster and Clay the gratitude of our own
and all later generations. The burst of loyalty in
April, 1861, had no less of its genesis in the intrepid
front and the political success of the national
administration from 1831 to 1833, than in the pathetic
and glorious appeals and aspirations of the
great orators.</p>

<p>Jackson now called to the work Edward Livingston,
privileged to perform in it that service of
his which deserves a splendid immortality. He became
secretary of state on May 24, 1831. Eaton,
the secretary of war, voluntarily resigned to become
governor of Florida; and Barry, the postmaster-general,
who was friendly to the reorganization,
was soon appointed minister to Spain, in which
post Eaton later succeeded him. Ingham, Branch,
and Berrien, the Calhoun members, were required
to resign. The new cabinet, apart from the state
department, was on the whole far abler than the
old; indeed, it was one of the ablest of American
cabinets. Below Livingston at the council table
sat McLane of Delaware, recalled from the British
mission to take the treasury, Governor Cass of
Michigan, and Senator Woodbury of New Hampshire,
secretaries of war and navy. Amos Kendall
brought to the post-office his extraordinary astuteness
and diligence in administration; and Taney,
later the chief justice, was attorney-general. The
executive talents of this body of men, loyal as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
they were to the plans of Jackson and Van Buren,
promised, and they afterwards brought, success in
the struggle for the principles now adopted by the
party, as well as for the control of the government.
Van Buren stood as truly for a policy of state
as ever stood any candidate before the American
people. One finds it agreeable now to escape for
a moment from the Washington atmosphere of personal
controversy and ambition. It is not to be
forgotten, however, that a like atmosphere has surrounded
even those political struggles in America,
only three or four in number, which have been
greater and deeper than that in which Jackson
and Van Buren were the chief figures. From this
temper of personal controversy and ambition the
greatest political benefactors of history have not
been free, so inevitable is the mingling with large
affairs of the varied personal motives, conscious
and unconscious, of those who transact them.</p>

<p>When Van Buren left the first place in Jackson's
cabinet, the latter, too, at last stood for
the definite policy which he had but imperfectly
adopted when he was elected, and which, as a practical
and immediate political plan, it is reasonably
safe to assert, was most largely the creation of the
sagacious mind of his chief associate. Before Van
Buren left Albany he had written to Hamilton on
February 21, 1829, with reference to Jackson's
inaugural: "I hope the general will not find it
necessary to avow any opinion upon constitutional
questions at war with the doctrines of the Jefferson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
school. Whatever his views may be, there can be
no necessity of doing so in an inaugural address."
This shows the doubt, which had been caused by
some of Jackson's utterances and votes, of his intelligent
and systematic adherence to the political
creed preached by Van Buren. Jackson's inaugural
was colorless and safe enough. Upon strict
construction he said that he should "keep steadily
in view the limitations as well as the extent of the
executive power;" that he would be "animated by
a proper respect for those sovereign members of
our Union, taking care not to confound the powers
they have reserved to themselves with those they
have granted to the confederacy." The bank he
did not mention. And upon the living and really
great question, to which Van Buren had given so
much study, Jackson said, himself probably having
a grim sense of humor at the absurd emptiness of
the sentence: "Internal improvement and the diffusion
of knowledge, so far as they can be promoted
by the constitutional acts of the federal government,
are of high importance."</p>

<p>Very different was the situation when two years
later Van Buren left the cabinet. In several state
papers of great dignity and ability and yet popular
and interesting in style, Jackson had formulated
a political creed closely consistent with that advocated
by Van Buren in the Senate. Upon internal
improvements, Jackson, on May 27, 1830, sent
to the House his famous Maysville Road veto.
That road was exclusively within the State of Ohio,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and not connected with any existing system of improvements.
Jackson very well said that if it
could be considered national, no further distinction
between the appropriate duties of the general and
state governments need be attempted. He pointed
out the tendency of such appropriations, little by
little, to distort the meaning of the Constitution;
and found in former legislation "an admonitory
proof of the force of implication, and that necessity
of guarding the Constitution with sleepless vigilance
against the authority of precedents which
have not the sanction of its most plainly defined
powers." In his annual message of December,
1830, he referred to the system of federal subscriptions
to private corporate enterprises, saying: "The
power which the general government would acquire
within the several States by becoming the principal
stockholder in corporations, controlling every canal
and each sixty or hundred miles of every important
road, and giving a proportionate vote to all their
elections, is almost inconceivable, and in my view
dangerous to the liberties of the people." With
these utterances ended the very critical struggle to
give the federal government a power which even
in those days would have been great, and which, as
has already been said, had it continued with the
growth of railways, would have enormously and
radically changed our system of government.</p>

<p>Before he left the Senate Van Buren had pronounced
against the Bank of the United States; but
Jackson did not mention it in his inaugural. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
his first annual message, however, Jackson warned
Congress that the charter of the bank would
expire in 1836, and that deliberation upon its renewal
ought to commence at once. "Both the
constitutionality and the expediency of the law
creating this bank," he said, "are well questioned ...; and
it must be admitted by all that it has
failed in the great end of establishing a uniform
and sound currency." This was plain enough for
a first utterance. A year later he told Congress
that nothing had occurred to lessen in any degree
the dangers which many citizens apprehended from
that institution as then organized, though he outlined
an institution which should be not a corporation,
but a branch of the Treasury Department,
and not, as he thought, obnoxious to constitutional
objections.</p>

<p>The removal of the Cherokee Indians from
within the State of Georgia he defended by considerations
which were practically unanswerable. It
was dangerously inconsistent with our political system
to maintain within the limits of a State Indian
tribes, free from the obligations of state laws,
having a tribal independence, and bound only by
treaty relations with the United States. It was
harsh to remove the Indians; but it would have
been harsher to them and to the white people of
the State to have supported by federal arms an
Indian sovereignty within its limits. Jackson, with
true Democratic jealousy, refused in his political
and executive policy to defer to the merely moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
weight of the opinion of the Supreme Court. For
in that tribunal political and social exigencies could
have but limited force in answering a question
which, as the court itself decided, called for a political
remedy, which the President and not the court
could apply.</p>

<p>The tariff might, Jackson declared, be constitutionally
used for protective purposes; but the deliberate
policy of his party was now plainly intimated.
In his first message he "regretted that the
complicated restrictions which now embarrass the
intercourse of nations could not by common consent
be abolished." In the Maysville veto he said that,
"as long as the encouragement of domestic manufactures"
was "directed to national ends," ... it
should receive from him "a temperate but steady
support." But this is to be read with the expression
in the same paper that the people had a right
to demand "the reduction of every tax to as low a
point as the wise observance of the necessity to
protect that portion of our manufactures and labor,
whose prosperity is essential to our national safety
and independence, will allow." This encouragement
was, he said in his inaugural, to be given to
those products which might be found "essential to
our national independence." In his second message
he declared "the obligations upon all the trustees
of political power to exempt those for whom
they act from all unnecessary burdens;" that "the
resources of the nation beyond those required for
the immediate and necessary purposes of govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ment
can nowhere be so well deposited as in the
pockets of the people;" that "objects of national
importance alone ought to be protected;" and that
"of those the productions of our soil, our mines,
and our workshops, essential to national defense,
occupy the first rank." Other domestic industries,
having a national importance, and which might,
after temporary protection, compete with foreign
labor on equal terms, merited, he said, the same
attention in a subordinate degree. The economic
light here was not very clear or strong, but perhaps
as strong as it often is in a political paper. Jackson's
conclusion was that the tariff then existing
taxed some of the comforts of life too highly; protected
interests too local and minute to justify a
general exaction; and forced some manufactures
for which the country was not ripe.</p>

<p>All this practical and striking growth in political
science had taken place during the two years of
Jackson's and Van Buren's almost daily intercourse
at Washington. It is impossible from materials
yet made public to point out with precision the
latter's handiwork in each of these papers. James
A. Hamilton describes his own long nights at the
White House on the messages of 1829 and 1830;
and his were not the only nights of the kind spent
by Jackson's friends. Jackson, like other strong
men, and like some whose opportunities of education
had been far ampler than his, freely used literary
assistance, although, with all his inaccuracies,
he himself wrote in a vigorous, lucid, and interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>ing
style. But with little doubt the political positions
taken in these papers, and which made a
definite and lasting creed, were more immediately
the work of the secretary of state. The consultations
with Van Buren, of which Hamilton tells, are
only glimpses of what must continually have gone
on. At the time of Jackson's inauguration Hamilton
wrote that the latter's confidence was reposed
in men in no way equal to him in natural parts,
but who had been useful to him in covering "his
very lamentable defects of education," and whom,
through his reluctance to expose these defects to
others, he was compelled to keep about him. He
added that Van Buren could never reach the same
relation which Lewis held with the general, because
the latter would "not yield himself so readily to
superior as to inferior minds." This was a mistake.
Van Buren's personal loyalty to Jackson, his remarkable
tact and delicacy, had promptly aroused
in Jackson that extraordinary liking for him which
lasted until Jackson died. With this advantage,
Van Buren's clear-cut theories of political conduct
were easily lodged in Jackson's naturally wise
mind, to whose prepossessions and prejudices they
were agreeable, and received there the deference
due to the practical sagacity in which Van Buren's
obvious political success had proved him to be a
master. Van Buren was doubtless greatly aided
by the kitchen cabinet. He was careful to keep
on good terms with those who had so familiar an
access to Jackson. Kendall's singular and useful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
ability he soon discovered. It was at the latter's
instance that Kendall was invited to dinner at the
White House, where Van Buren paid him special
attention. The influence of the members of the
kitchen cabinet with their master has been much
exaggerated. Soon after Lewis was appointed,
and in spite of his personal intimacy and of his
rumored influence with the President, he was, as
he wrote to Hamilton, in some anxiety whether he
might not be removed; the President had at least,
he said, entertained a proposition to remove him,
and was therefore, in view of Jackson's great debt
to him, no longer entitled to his "friendship or
future support."</p>

<p>Very soon after Van Buren's withdrawal from
the cabinet, he was accused of primarily and chiefly
causing the official proscription of men for political
opinions which began in the federal service under
Jackson. From that time to the present the accusation
has been carelessly repeated from one writer
to another, with little original examination of the
facts. It is clear that Van Buren neither began
nor caused this demoralizing and disastrous abuse.
When he reached Washington in 1829, the removals
were in full and lamentable progress. In
the very first days of the administration, McLean
was removed from the office of postmaster-general
to a seat in the Supreme Court, because, so Adams
after an interview with him wrote in his diary on
March 14,1829, "he refused to be made the instrument
of the sweeping proscription of postmasters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
which is to be one of the samples of the promised
reform." This was a week or two before Van
Buren reached Washington. On the same day
Samuel Swartwout wrote to Hoyt from Washington:
"No damned rascal who made use of his
office or its profits for the purpose of keeping Mr.
Adams in, and General Jackson out of power, is
entitled to the least lenity or mercy, save that of
hanging.... Whether or not I shall get anything
in the general scramble for plunder remains to be
proven; but I rather guess I shall.... I know
Mr. Ingham slightly, and would recommend you to
push like a devil, if you expect anything from that
quarter.... If I can only keep my own legs, I
shall do well; but I'm darned if I can carry any
weight with me." This man, against Van Buren's
earnest protest and to his great disturbance, had
some of the devil's luck in pushing. He was appointed
collector of customs at New York,&mdash;one
of the principal financial officers in the country.
It is not altogether unsatisfactory to read of the
scandalous defalcation of which he was afterwards
guilty, and of the serious injury it dealt his party.
The temper which he exposed so ingenuously, filled
Washington at the time. Nor did it come only or
chiefly from one quarter of the country. Kendall,
then fresh from Kentucky, who had been appointed
fourth auditor, wrote to his wife, with interestingly
mingled sentiments: "I turned out six clerks on
Saturday. Several of them have families and are
poor. It was the most painful thing I ever did;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
but I could not well get along without it. Among
them is a poor old man with a young wife and several
children. I shall help to raise a contribution
to get him back to Ohio.... I shall have a private
carriage to go out with me and bring my
whole brood of little ones. Bless their sweet
faces."</p>

<p>Van Buren confidentially wrote to Hamilton
from Albany in March, 1829: "If the general
makes one removal at this moment he must go on.
Would it not be better to get the streets of Washington
clear of office-seekers first in the way I proposed?... As
to the publication in the newspapers
I have more to say. So far as depends on
me, my course will be to restore by a single order
every one who has been turned out by Mr. Clay
for political reasons, unless circumstances of a personal
character have since arisen which would make
the reappointment in any case improper. To ascertain
that will take a little time. There I would
pause." Among the Mackenzie letters is one from
Lorenzo Hoyt, describing an interview with Van
Buren while governor, and then complaining that
the latter would "not lend the utmost weight of
his influence to displace from office such men as
John Duer," Adams's appointee as United States
attorney at New York. If they had been struggling
for political success for the benefit of their
opponents, he angrily wrote, he wished to know
it. He added, however, that, from the behavior
of the President thus far, he thought Jackson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
would "go the whole hog." This was before Van
Buren reached Washington. In answer to an
insolent letter of Jesse Hoyt urging a removal,
and telling the secretary of state that there was a
"charm attending bold measures extremely fascinating"
which had given Jackson all his glory,
Van Buren wrote back: "Here I am engaged in
the most intricate and important affairs, which are
new to me, and upon the successful conduct of
which my reputation as well as the interests of the
country depend, and which keep me occupied from
early in the morning until late at night. And can
you think it kind or just to harass me under such
circumstances with letters which no man of common
sensibility can read without pain?... I must be
plain with you.... The terms upon which you
have seen fit to place our intercourse are inadmissible."
Ingham, Jackson's secretary of the
treasury, the next day wrote to this typical office-seeker
that the rage for office in New York was
such that an enemy menacing the city with desolation
would not cause more excitement. He added,
speaking of his own legitimate work: "These
duties cannot be postponed; and I do assure you
that I am compelled daily to file away long lists of
recommendations, etc., without reading them, although
I work 18 hours out of the 24 with all
diligence. The appointments can be postponed;
other matters cannot; and it was one of the prominent
errors of the late administration that they
suffered many important public interests to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
neglected, while they were cruising about to secure
or buy up partisans. This we must not do."</p>

<p>Benton, friendly as he was to Jackson, condemned
the system of removals; and his fairness
may well be trusted. He said that in Jackson's
first year (in which De Tocqueville, whom he was
answering, said that Jackson had removed every
removable functionary) there were removed but
690 officers through the whole United States for
all causes, of whom 491 were postmasters: the entire
number of postmasters being at the time nearly
8000. Kendall, reviewing the first three years of
Jackson's administration near their expiration, said
that in the city of Washington there had been
removed but one officer out of seven, and "most of
them for bad conduct and character," a statement
some of the significance of which doubtless depends
upon what was "bad character," but which still
fairly limits the epithet "wholesale" customarily
applied to these removals. In the Post-Office Department,
he said, the removals had been only one
out of sixteen, and in the whole government but
one out of eleven. Kendall was speaking for party
purposes; but he was cautious and precise; and
his statements, made near the time, show how far
behind the sudden "clean sweep" of 1861 was
this earlier essay in "spoils," and how much exaggeration
there has been on the subject. Benton
says that in the departments at Washington a
majority of the employees were opposed to Jackson
throughout his administration. Of the officers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
having a judicial function, such as land and claims
commissioners, territorial judges, justices in the
District of Columbia, none were removed. The
readiness to remove was stimulated by the discovery
of the frauds of Tobias Watkins, made just after
his removal from the fourth auditor's place, to
which Kendall was appointed. Watkins had been
Adams's warm personal friend, so the latter states
in his diary, and "an over active partisan against
Jackson at the last presidential election." Unreasonable
as was a general inference from one of
the instances of dishonesty which occur under the
best administrations, and a flagrant instance of
which was soon to occur under his own administration,
it justified Jackson in his own eyes for many
really shameful removals. There had doubtless
been among office-holders under Adams a good
deal of the "offensive partisanship" of our day,
many expressions of horror by subordinate officers
at the picture of Jackson as president. All this
had angered Jackson, whose imperial temper readily
classed his subordinates as servants of Andrew
Jackson, rather than as ministers of the public
service. Moreover, his accession, as Benton not
unfairly pointed out, was the first great party
change since Jefferson had succeeded the elder
Adams. Offices had greatly increased in number.
In the profound democratic change that had been
actively operating for a quarter of a century, the
force of old traditions had been broken in many
useful as in many useless things. Great numbers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of inferior offices had now become political, not
only in New York, but in Pennsylvania, Georgia,
and other States. Adams's administration, except
in the change of policy upon large questions, had
been a continuation of Monroe's. He went from
the first place in Monroe's cabinet to the presidency.
His secretaries of the treasury and the
navy and his postmaster-general and attorney-general
had held office under Monroe, the latter three
in the very same places. But Jackson thrust out
of the presidency his rival, who had naturally
enough been earnestly sustained by large numbers
of his subordinates; and Adams's appointees were
doubtless in general followers of himself and of
Clay.</p>

<p>Jackson's first message contained a serious defense
of the removals. Men long in office, he said,
acquired the "habit of looking with indifference
upon the public interests," and office became considered
"a species of property." "The duties of
all public officers," he declared, with an ignorance
then very common among Americans, could be
"made so plain and simple that men of intelligence
may readily qualify themselves for their performance."
Further, he pointed out that no one man
had "any more intrinsic right" to office than another;
and therefore "no individual wrong" was
done by removal. The officer removed, he concluded,
with almost a demagogic touch, had the
same means of earning a living as "the millions
who never held office." In spite of individual dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>tress
he wished "rotation in office" to become "a
leading principle in the Republican creed." Unfounded
as most of this is now clearly seen to be,
it is certain that the reasoning was convincing to a
very large part of the American people.</p>

<p>In his own department Van Buren practiced
little of the proscription which was active elsewhere.
Of seventeen foreign representatives, but
four were removed in the first year. Doubtless
he was fortunate in having an office without the
amount of patronage of the Post-Office or the
Treasury. Nothing in his career, however, showed
a personal liking for removals. The distribution
of offices was not distasteful to him; but his temper
was neither prescriptive nor unfriendly. At
times even his partisan loyalty was doubted for his
reluctance in this, which was soon deemed an appropriate
and even necessary party work.</p>

<p>But Van Buren did not oppose the ruinous and
demoralizing system. Powerful as he was with
Jackson, wise and far-seeing as he was, he must
receive for his acquiescence, or even for his silence,
a part of the condemnation which the American
people, as time goes on, will more and more visit
upon one of the great political offenses committed
against their political integrity and welfare. But
it must in justice be remembered, not only that
Van Buren did not begin or actively conduct the
distribution of spoils; not only that his acquiescence
was in a practice which in his own State he
had found well established; but that the practice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in which he thus joined was one which it is probable
he could not have fully resisted without his
own political destruction, and perhaps the temporary
prostration of the political causes to which he
was devoted. Though these be palliations and not
defenses, the biographer ought not to apply to
human nature a rule of unprecedented austerity.
In Van Buren's politic yielding there was little, if
any, more timidity or time-serving than in the like
yielding by every man holding great office in the
United States since Jackson's inauguration; and
the worst, the most corrupting, and the most demoralizing
official proscription in America took
place thirty-two years afterwards, and under a
president who, in wise and exalted patriotism, was
one of the greatest statesmen, as he has been perhaps
the best loved, of Americans, and to whom
blame ought to be assigned all the larger by reason
of the extraordinary power and prestige he
enjoyed, and the moral fervor of the nation behind
him, which rendered less necessary this unworthy
aid of inferior patronage.</p>

<p>So crowded and interesting were the two years
of Van Buren's life in the cabinet with matters
apart from the special duties of his office, that it
is only at the last, and briefly, that an account can
be given of his career as secretary of state. His
conduct of foreign affairs was firm, adroit, dignified,
and highly successful. It utterly broke
the ideal of turbulent and menacing incompetence
which the Whigs set up for Jackson's presidency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
He had to solve no difficulty of the very first
order; for the United States were in profound
peace with the whole world. He performed, however,
with skill and success two diplomatic services
of real importance, services which brought deserved
and most valuable strength to Jackson's
administration. The American claims for French
spoliations upon American ships during the operation
of Napoleon's Berlin and Milan decrees had
been under discussion for many years. They were
now resolutely pressed. In his message of December,
1829, Jackson, doubtless under Van Buren's
advice, paid some compliments to "France, our
ancient ally;" but then said very plainly that
these claims, unless satisfied, would continue "a
subject of unpleasant discussion and possible collision
between the two governments." He politely
referred to "the known integrity of the French
monarch," Charles X., as an assurance that the
claims would be paid. A few months afterwards
this Bourbon was tumbled off the French throne;
and in December, 1830, Jackson with increased
courtliness, and with a flattering allusion to Lafayette,
conspicuous in this milder revolution as he
had been in 1789, rejoiced in "the high voucher
we possess for the enlarged views and pure integrity"
of Louis Philippe. The new American
vigor, doubtless aided by the liberal change in
France, brought a treaty on July 4, 1831, under
which $5,000,000 was to be paid by France, a
result which Jackson, with pardonable boasting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
said in his message of December, 1831, was an
encouragement "for perseverance in the demands
of justice," and would admonish other powers, if
any, inclined to evade those demands, that they
would never be abandoned. The French treaty
came so soon after Van Buren's retirement from
the state department, and followed so naturally
upon the methods of his negotiation, and his instructions
to William C. Rives, our minister at
Paris, that much of its credit belonged to him. In
March, 1830, a treaty was made with Denmark
requiring the payment of $650,000 for Danish
spoliations on American commerce. The effective
pressing of these claims was justly one of the most
popular performances of the administration. Commercial
treaties were concluded with Austria in
August, 1829; with Turkey in May, 1830; and
with Mexico in April, 1831.</p>

<p>But the chief transaction of Van Buren's foreign
administration was the opening of trade in American
vessels between the United States and the
British West Indian colonies. This commerce was
then relatively much more important to the United
States than in later times; and it was chiefly by
American shipping that American commerce was
carried on with foreign countries. The absurd and
odious restrictions upon intercourse so highly natural
and advantageous to the people of our seaboard
and of the British West Indian islands had led to
smuggling on a large scale, and were fruitful of
international irritations. Retaliatory acts of Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>gress
and Parliament, prohibitive proclamations of
our presidents, and British orders in council, had
at different times, since the close of the second
British war in 1815, oppressed or prevented honest
and profitable trade between neighbors who ought
to have been friendly traders. Van Buren found
the immediate position to be as follows. In July,
1825, an act of Parliament had allowed foreign
vessels to trade to the British colonies upon conditions.
To secure for American vessels the benefit
of this act, it was necessary that within one year
American ports should be open to British vessels
bringing the same kind of British or colonial produce
as could be imported in American vessels;
that British and American vessels in the trade
should pay the same government charges; that
alien duties on British vessels and cargoes, that is,
duties not imposed on the like vessels and cargoes
owned by Americans, should be suspended; and
that the provision of an American law of 1823
limiting the privileges of the colonial trade to British
vessels carrying colonial produce to American
ports directly from the colonies exporting it, and
without stopping at intermediate ports, should be
repealed. John Quincy Adams's administration
had failed within the year to comply with the conditions
imposed by the British law of 1825. In
1826, therefore, Great Britain forbade this trade
and intercourse in American vessels. Adams retorted
with a counter prohibition in March, 1827.
And in this unfortunate position Van Buren found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
our commercial relations with the West Indian,
Bahama, and South American colonies of England.
The situation was aggravated by a claim made by
the American government in 1823 that American
goods should pay in the colonial ports no higher
duties than British goods, a protest against British
protection to British industry in the British colonies
coming with little grace from a country itself
maintaining the protective system. Adams had
sent Gallatin to England to remedy the difficulty,
but without success.</p>

<p>Van Buren adopted a different method of negotiation.
A more conciliatory bearing was assumed
towards our traditional adversary. Jackson, in
language sounding strangely from his imperious
mouth, was made to say in his first message that
"with Great Britain, alike distinguished in peace
and war, we may look forward to years of peaceful,
honorable, and elevated competition; that it is
their policy to preserve the most cordial relations."
These, he said, were his own views; and such were
"the prevailing sentiments of our constituents."
In his instructions to McLane, the minister at
London, Van Buren, departing widely from conventional
diplomacy, expressly conceded that the
American government had been wrong in its claim
that England should admit to its colonies American
goods on as favorable terms as British goods; that
it had been wrong in requiring British ships bringing
colonial produce to come and go directly from
and to the producing colonies; and that it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
been wrong in refusing the privileges offered by
the British law of 1825. This frank surrender of
untenable positions showed the highest skill in negotiation,
a business for which Van Buren was
perhaps better equipped than any American of his
time. In these points we were "assailable;" we
had "too long and too tenaciously" resisted British
rights. After these admissions, it would, he
said, be improper for Great Britain to suffer "any
feelings that find their origin in the past pretensions
of this government to have an adverse influence
upon the present conduct of Great Britain."
McLane was to tell the Earl of Aberdeen that "to
set up the act of the late administration as the
cause of forfeiture of privileges which would otherwise
be extended to the people of the United States
would, under existing circumstances, be unjust in
itself, and could not fail to excite their deepest
sensibility." McLane was also to allude to the
parts taken by the members of Jackson's administration
in the former treatment of the question
under discussion. And here Van Buren used the
objectionable sentence which led to his subsequent
rejection by the Senate as minister to England,
and which through that, such are the curious caprices
of politics, led, or at least helped to lead,
him to the presidency. He said, "Their views
upon that point have been submitted to the people
of the United States; and the counsels by which
your conduct is now directed are the result of the
judgment expressed by the only earthly tribunal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
to which the late administration was amenable for
its acts."</p>

<p>In Van Buren's sagacious desire to emphasize
the abandonment of claims preventing the negotiation,
he here introduced to a foreign nation the
American people as a judge that had condemned
the assertion of such claims by Jackson's predecessor.
The statement was at least an exaggeration.
There was little reason to suppose that Adams's
failure in the negotiation over colonial trade had
much, if at all, influenced the election of 1828.
Nor was it dignified to officially expose our party
contests to foreign eyes. But Van Buren was intent
upon success in the negotiation. He could
succeed where others had failed, only by a strong
assertion of a change in American policy. His
fault was at most one of taste in the manner of an
assertion right enough and wise enough in itself.
Nor were these celebrated instructions lacking in
firmness or dignity. Great Britain was clearly
warned that she must then decide for all time
whether the hardships from which her West Indian
planters suffered should continue; and that the
United States would not "in expiation of supposed
past encroachments" repeal their laws, leaving
themselves "wholly dependent upon the indulgence
of Great Britain," and not knowing in advance
what course she would follow. In his speech in
the Senate in February, 1827, Van Buren had
clearly stated the general positions which he took
in this famous dispatch. It is rather curious, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ever,
that he found occasion then to say upon this
very subject what he seemed afterwards to forget,
that "in the collisions which may arise between
the United States and a foreign power, it is our
duty to present an unbroken front; domestic differences,
if they tend to give encouragement to
unjust pretensions, should be extinguished or deferred;
and the cause of our government must be
considered as the cause of our country." So easy
it is to advise other men to be bold and firm.</p>

<p>McLane's long and very able letter to the British
foreign secretary closely followed his instructions.
Lord Aberdeen was frankly told that the United
States had committed "mistakes" in the past; and
that the "American pretensions" which had prevented
a former arrangement would not be revived.
The negotiation was entirely successful. In October,
1830, the President, with the authorization of
Congress, declared American ports open to British
vessels and their cargoes coming from the colonies,
and that they should be subject to the same charges
as American vessels coming from the same colonies.
In November a British order in council gave to
American vessels corresponding privileges. On
January 3, 1831, Jackson sent to the Senate the
papers, including Van Buren's letter of instructions.
No criticism was made upon their tenor;
and the public, heedless of the phrases used in
reaching the end, rejoiced in a most beneficent
opening of commerce.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="ft80">MINISTER TO ENGLAND.&mdash;VICE-PRESIDENT.&mdash;ELECTION
TO THE PRESIDENCY</span></h2>


<p>In the summer of 1831 Van Buren knew very
well the strong hold he had upon his party, the
entire and almost affectionate confidence which he
enjoyed from Jackson, and the prestige which his
political and official success had brought him. But
to the country, as he was well aware, he seemed
also to be, as he was, a politician, obviously skilled
in the art, and an avowed candidate for the presidency.
His conciliatory bearing, his abstinence
from personal abuse, his freedom from personal
animosities, all were widely declared to be the
mere incidents of constant duplicity and intrigue.
The absence of proof, and his own explicit denial
and appeal to those who knew the facts, did not
protect him from the belief of his adversaries&mdash;a
belief which, without examination, has since been
widely adopted&mdash;that to prostrate a dangerous
rival he had promoted the quarrel between Jackson
and Calhoun. McLane, the minister at London,
wished to come home, and was to be the new secretary
of the treasury. Van Buren gladly seized the
opportunity. He would leave the field of political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
management. Three thousand miles in distance
and a month in time away from Washington or
New York, there could, he thought, be little pretense
of personal man&#339;uvres on his part. He
would thus plainly submit his candidacy to popular
judgment upon his public career, without interference
from himself. He would escape the many
embarrassments of every politician upon whom
demands are continually made,&mdash;demands whose
rejection or allowance alike brings offense. The
English mission was prominently in the public service,
but out of its difficulties; and it was made
particularly grateful to him by his success in the
recent negotiation over colonial trade. He therefore
accepted the post, for which in almost every
respect he had extraordinary equipment. He finally
left the State Department in June, 1831; and on
his departure from Washington Jackson conspicuously
rode with him out of the city. On August
1, he was formally appointed minister to Great
Britain; and in September he arrived in London,
accompanied by his son John.</p>

<p>Van Buren found Washington Irving presiding
over the London legation in McLane's absence as
<i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>. Irving's appointment to be secretary
of legation under McLane had been one of
Van Buren's early acts,&mdash;a proof, Irving wrote,
"of the odd way in which this mad world is governed,
when a secretary of state of a stern republic
gives away offices of the kind at the recommendation
of a jovial little man of the seas like Jack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Nicholson." But this was jocose. When the appointment
was suggested, it was particularly pleasant
to Van Buren that this graceful and gentle bit
of patronage should be given by so grim a figure
as Jackson. Irving had come on from Spain, his
"Columbus" just finished, and his "Alhambra
Tales" ready for writing. His extraordinary popularity
in England and his old familiarity with
its life made him highly useful to the American
minister, as Van Buren himself soon found. It
was not the last time that Englishmen respected
the republic of the west the more because the respect
carried with it an homage to the republic of
letters. Irving's was an early one of the appointments
which established the agreeable tradition of
the American diplomatic and consular service, that
literary men should always hold some of its places
of honor and profit. When Van Buren arrived,
Irving was already weary of his post and had resigned.
He remained, however, with the new minister
until he too surrendered his office. The two
men became warm and lifelong friends. The day
after Van Buren's arrival Irving wrote: "I have
just seen Mr. Van Buren, and do not wonder you
should all be so fond of him. His manners are
most amiable and ingratiating; and I have no
doubt he will become a favorite at this court."
After an intimacy of several months he wrote:
"The more I see of Mr. Van Buren, the more I
feel confirmed in a strong personal regard for him.
He is one of the gentlest and most amiable men I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
have ever met with; with an affectionate disposition
that attaches itself to those around him, and
wins their kindness in return."</p>

<p>After a few months of the charming life which
an American of distinction finds open to him in
London, a life for whose duties and whose pleasures
Van Buren was happily fitted,<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> there came to him
an extraordinary and enviable delight. He posted
through England in an open carriage with the
author of the "Sketch Book" and "Bracebridge
Hall." From those daintiest sources he had years
before got an idea of English country life, and of
the festivities of an old-fashioned English Christmas;
and now in an exquisite companionship the
idea became more nearly clothed with reality than
happens with most literary enchantments. After
Oxford and Blenheim; after quartering in Stratford
at the little inn of the Red Horse, where they
"found the same obliging little landlady that kept
it at the time of the visit recorded in the 'Sketch
Book';" after Warwick Castle and Kenilworth
and Lichfield and Newstead Abbey and Hardwick
Castle; after a fortnight at Christmas in Barlborough
Hall,&mdash;"a complete scene of old English
hospitality," with many of the ancient games and
customs then obsolete in other parts of England;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
after seeing there the "mummers and morris
dancers and glee singers;" after "great feasting
with the boar's-head crowned with holly, the wassail
bowl, the yule-log, snapdragon, etc.;"&mdash;after
all these delights, inimitably told by his companion,
Van Buren returned to London, but not for long.
He there enjoyed the halcyon days which the brilliant
society of London knew, when George IV.
had just left the throne to his undignified but good-hearted
and jovial brother; when Louis Philippe
had found a bourgeois crown in France and the condescending
approval of England; when Wellington
was the first of Englishmen; when Prince Talleyrand,
his early republicanism and sacrileges not at
all forgotten, but forgiven to the prestige of his abilities
and the splendid fascinations of his society,
was the chief person in diplomatic life; when the
Wizard of the North, though broken, and on his
last and vain trip to the Mediterranean for health,
still lingered in London, one of its grand figures,
and sadly recalled to Irving the times when they
"went over the Eildon hills together;" when
Rogers was playing M&aelig;cenas and Catullus at
breakfast-tables of poets and bankers and noblemen.
It was amid this serene, shining, and magical
translation from the politics at home that Van
Buren received the rude and humiliating news of
his rejection by the Senate; for his appointment
had been made in recess, and he had left without a
confirmation.</p>

<p>One evening in February, 1832, before attending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
a party at Talleyrand's, Van Buren learned of the
rejection, as had all London which knew there was
an American minister. He was half ill when the
news came; but he seemed imperturbable. Without
shrinking he mixed in the splendid throng,
gracious and easy, as if he did not know that his
official heart would soon cease to beat. Lord
Auckland, then president of the board of trade
and afterwards governor-general of India, said to
him very truly, and more prophetically than he
fancied: "It is an advantage to a public man to
be the subject of an outrage." Levees and drawing-rooms
and state dinners were being held in
honor of the queen's birthday. After a doubt as
to the more decorous course, he kept the tenor of
diplomatic life until he ceased to be a minister;
and Irving said that, "to the credit of John Bull,"
he "was universally received with the most marked
attention," and "treated with more respect and
attention than before by the royal family, by the
members of the present and the old cabinet, and
the different persons of the diplomatic corps." On
March 22, 1832, he had his audience of leave; two
days later he dined with the king at Windsor;
and about April 1 left for Holland and a continental
trip, this being, so he wrote a committee
appointed at an indignation meeting in Tammany
Hall, "the only opportunity" he should probably
ever have for the visit.</p>

<p>Van Buren's dispatches from England, now preserved
in the archives of the State Department,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
are not numerous. They were evidently written
by a minister who was not very busy in official
duties apart from the social and ceremonial life of
a diplomat. Some of them are in his own handwriting,
whose straggling carelessness is quite out
of keeping with the obvious pains which he bestowed
upon every subject he touched, even those of
seemingly slight consequence. Interspersed with
allusions to the northeastern boundary question,
and with accounts of his protests against abuses
practiced upon American ships in British ports,
and of the spread of the cholera, he gave English
political news and even gossip. He discussed the
chances of the reform bill, rumors of what the
ministry would do, and whether the Duke of Wellington
would yield. Van Buren participated in
no important dispute, although before surrendering
his post he presented one of the hateful claims
which American administrations of both parties
had to make in those days. This was the demand
for slaves who escaped from the American brig
"Comet," wrecked in the Bahamas, on her way
from the Potomac to New Orleans, and who were
declared free by the colonial authorities.</p>

<p>It is safe to believe that Secretary Livingston
read the more interesting of these letters at the
White House. Van Buren discreetly lightened up
some of the diplomatic pages with passages very
agreeable to Jackson. In describing his presentation
to William IV., he told Livingston that the
king had formed the highest estimate of Jackson's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
character, and repeated the royal remark "that
detraction and misrepresentation were the common
lot of all public men." Of the President's message
of December, 1831, he wrote that few in England
refused to recognize its ability or the "distinguished
talents of the executive by whose advice
and labors" the affairs "of our highly favored
country" had been "conducted to such happy results."</p>

<p>On July 5, 1832, Van Buren arrived at New
York, having several weeks before been nominated
for the vice-presidency. He declined a public reception,
he said, because, afflicted as New York
was with the cholera, festivities would be discordant
with the feelings of his friends; and a few days
later he was in Washington. Congress was in
session, debating the tariff bill; and he quickly
enough found it true, as he had already believed,
that his rejection had been a capital blunder of
his enemies. The rejection occurred on January
25, 1832. Jackson's nomination had gone to the
Senate early in December, but the opposition had
hesitated at the responsibility for the affront. The
debate took place in secret session, but the speeches
were promptly made public for their effect on the
country. Clay and Webster, the great leaders of
the Whigs, and Hayne, the eloquent representative
of the Calhoun Democracy, and others, spoke
against Van Buren. Clay and Webster based their
rejection upon his language in the dispatch to
McLane, already quoted. Webster said that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
would pardon almost anything where he saw true
patriotism and sound American feeling; but he
could not forgive the sacrifice of these to party.
Van Buren, with sensible and skillful foresight,
had frankly admitted that we had been wrong in
some of our claims; and Gallatin, it was afterwards
shown from his original dispatch to Clay, had expressly
said the same thing. But in a bit of buncombe
Webster insisted that no American minister
must ever admit that his country had been wrong.
"In the presence of foreign courts," he solemnly
said, "amidst the monarchies of Europe, he is to
stand up for his country and his whole country;
that no jot nor tittle of her honor is to suffer in
his hands; that he is not to allow others to reproach
either his government or his country, and
far less is he himself to reproach either; that he is
to have no objects in his eye but American objects,
and no heart in his bosom but an American heart."
To say all this, Webster declared, was a duty
whose performance he wished might be heard "by
every independent freeman in the United States,
by the British minister and the British king, and
every minister and every crowned head in Europe."
Van Buren's language, Clay said, had been that of
an humble vassal to a proud and haughty lord,
prostrating and degrading the American eagle before
the British lion. These cheap appeals fell
perfectly flat. If Van Buren had been open to
criticism for the manner in which he pointed out a
party change in American administration, the error<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
was, at the worst, committed to preclude a British
refusal from finding justification in the offensive
attitude previously taken by Adams. In admitting
our mistaken "pretensions," Van Buren had been
entirely right, barring a slight fault in the word,
which did not, however, then seem to import the
consciousness of wrong which it carries to later
ears. Webster and Clay ought to have known
that Van Buren's success where all before had
failed would make the American people loath to
find fault with his phrases. Nor were they at
all ready to believe that Jackson's administration
toadied to foreign courts. They knew better; they
were convinced that no American president had
been more resolute towards other nations.</p>

<p>It was also said that Van Buren had introduced
the system of driving men from office for political
opinions; that he was a New York politician who
had brought his art to Washington. Marcy, one
of the New York senators, defended his State with
these words, which afterwards he must have wished
to recall: "It may be, sir, that the politicians of
New York are not so fastidious as some gentlemen
are as to disclosing the principles on which
they act. They boldly preach what they practice.
When they are contending for victory they avow
their intention of enjoying the fruits of it. If they
are defeated, they expect to retire from office; if
they are successful, they claim, as a matter of
right, the advantages of success. They see nothing
wrong in the rule that to the victor belong the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
spoils of the enemy." To this celebrated and execrable
defense Van Buren owes much of the later
and unjust belief that he was an inveterate "spoilsman."
It has already been shown how little foundation
there is for the charge that he introduced
the system of official proscription. Benton truly
said that Van Buren's temper and judgment were
both against it, and that he gave ample proofs of
his forbearance. Webster did not touch upon this
objection. Clay made it very subordinate to the
secretary's abasement before the British lion.</p>

<p>The attack of the Calhoun men was based upon
Van Buren's supposed intrigue against their chief,
and his breaking up of the cabinet. But people
saw then, better indeed than some historians have
since seen, that between Calhoun and Van Buren
there had been great and radical political divergence
far deeper than personal jealousy. To surrender
the highest cabinet office, to leave Washington
and all the places of political management, in
order to take a lower office in remote exile from
the sources of political power,&mdash;these were not believed
to be acts of mere trickery, but rather to be
parts of a courageous and self-respecting appeal for
justice. It seemed a piece of political animosity
wantonly to punish a rival with such exquisite
humiliation in the eyes of foreigners.</p>

<p>There was a clear majority against confirming
Van Buren. But to make his destruction the more
signal, and as Calhoun had no opportunity to
speak, enough of the majority refrained from vot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>ing
to enable the Democratic vice-president to give
the casting vote for the rejection of this Democratic
nominee. Calhoun's motive was obvious
enough from his boast in Benton's hearing: "It
will kill him, sir, kill him dead. He will never
kick, sir, never kick." This bit of unaffected nature
was refreshing after all the solemnly insincere
declarations of grief which had fallen from the
opposition senators in performing their duty.</p>

<p>The folly of the rejection was quickly apparent.
Benton very well said to Moore, a senator from
Alabama who had voted against Van Buren, "You
have broken a minister and elected a vice-president.
The people will see nothing in it but a combination
of rivals against a competitor." The popular verdict
was promptly given. Van Buren had already
become a candidate to succeed Jackson five years
later; he was only a possible candidate for vice-president
at the next election. When the rejection
was widely known, it was known almost equally
well and soon that Van Buren would be the Jacksonian
candidate for vice-president. Meetings were
held; addresses were voted; the issue was eagerly
seized. The Democratic members of the New
York legislature early in February, 1832, under an
inspiration from Washington, addressed to Jackson
an expression of their indignation in the stately
words which our fathers loved, even when they
went dangerously near to bathos. They had freely,
they said, surrendered to his call their most distinguished
fellow-citizen; when Van Buren had with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>drawn
from the cabinet they had beheld in Jackson's
continual confidence in him irrefragable proof
that no combination could close Jackson's eyes to
the cause of his country; New York would indeed
avenge the indignity thus offered to her favorite
son; but they would be unmindful of their duty
if they failed to console Jackson with their sympathy
in this degradation of the country he loved
so well. On February 28, Jackson replied with
no less dignity and with skill and force. He was,
he said,&mdash;and the whole country believed him,&mdash;incapable
of tarnishing the pride or dignity of that
country whose glory it had been his object to elevate;
Van Buren's instructions to McLane had
been his instructions; American pretensions which
Adams's administration had admitted to be untenable
had been resigned; if just American claims
were resisted upon the ground of the unjust position
taken by his predecessor, then and then only
was McLane to point out that there had been a
change in the policy and counsels of the government
with the change of its officers. Jackson said
that he owed it to the late secretary of state and to
the American people to declare that Van Buren had
no participation whatever in the occurrences between
Calhoun and himself; and that there was
no ground for imputing to Van Buren advice to
make the removals from office. He had called Van
Buren to the state department not more for his
acknowledged talents and public services than to
meet the general wish and expectation of the Re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>publican
party; his signal ability and success in
office had fully justified the selection; his own
respect for Van Buren's great public and private
worth, and his full confidence in his integrity were
undiminished. This blast from the unquestioned
head of the party prodigiously helped the general
movement. The only question was how best to
avenge the wrong.</p>

<p>It was suggested that Van Buren should return
directly and take a seat in the Senate, which Dudley
would willingly surrender to him, and should
there meet his slanderers face to face. Some
thought that he should have a triumphal entry
into New York, without an idea of going into the
"senatorial cock-pit" unless he were not to receive
the vice-presidency. Others thought that he
should be made governor of New York, an idea
shadowed forth in the Albany address to Jackson.
As a candidate for that place, he would escape the
jealousies of Pennsylvania and perhaps Virginia,
and augment the local strength of the party in
New York. To this it was replied from Washington
that they might better cut his throat at once;
that if the Republican party could not, under existing
circumstances, make Van Buren vice-president,
they need never look to the presidency for
him. This was declared to be the unanimous
opinion of the cabinet. New York Republicans
were begged not to "lose so glorious an opportunity
of strengthening and consolidating the party."
The people at Albany, it was said, were "mad, ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> as
if New York can make amends for an insult
offered by fourteen States of the Union."</p>

<p>In this temper the Republican or Democratic
convention met at Baltimore on May 21, 1832. It
was the first national gathering of the party; and
was summoned simply to nominate a vice-president.
Jackson's renomination was already made by the
sovereign people, which might be justly affronted
by the assembling of a body in apparent doubt
whether to obey the popular decree. National
conventions were inevitable upon the failure of the
congressional caucus in 1824. The system of separate
nominations in different States at irregular
times was too inconvenient, too inconsistent with
unity of action and a central survey of the whole
situation. In 1824 its inconvenience had been
obvious enough. In 1828 circumstances had designated
both the candidates with perfect certainty;
and isolated nominations in different parts of the
country were then in no danger of clashing. It
has been recently said that the convention of 1832
was assembled to force Van Buren's nomination for
vice-president. But it is evident from the letter
which Parton prints, written by Lewis to Kendall
on May 25, 1831, when the latter was visiting Isaac
Hill, the Jacksonian leader in New Hampshire,
that the convention was even then proposed by
"the most judicious" friends of the administration.
It was suggested as a plan "of putting a
stop to partial nominations" and of "harmonizing"
the party. Barbour, Dickinson, and McLane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
were the candidates discussed in this letter; Van
Buren was not named. He was about sailing for
England; and although an open candidate for the
presidential succession after Jackson, he was not
then a candidate for the second office. The ascription
of the convention to management in his behalf
seems purely gratuitous. Upon this early invitation,
the New Hampshire Democrats called the
convention. One of them opened its session by a
brief speech alluding to the favor with which the
idea of the convention had met, "although opposed
by the enemies of the Democratic party," as the
Republican party headed by Jackson was now perhaps
first definitely called. He said that "the
coming together of representatives of the people
from the extremity of the Union would have a
tendency to soothe, if not to unite, the jarring interests;"
and that the people, after seeing its good
effects in conciliating the different and distant sections
of the country, would continue the mode of
nomination. This natural and sensible motive to
strengthen and solidify the party is ample explanation
of the convention, without resorting to the
rather worn charge brought against so many political
movements of the time, that they arose from
Jackson's dictatorial desire to throttle the sentiment
of his party. In making nominations the
convention resolved that each State should have as
many votes as it would be entitled to in the electoral
college. To assure what was deemed a reasonable
approach to unanimity, two thirds of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
whole number of votes was required for a choice,&mdash;a
precedent sad enough to Van Buren twelve
years later. On the first ballot Van Buren had
208 of the 283 votes. Virginia, South Carolina,
Indiana, and Kentucky, with a few votes from
North Carolina, Alabama, and Illinois, were for
Philip P. Barbour of Virginia or Richard M.
Johnson of Kentucky. The motion, nowadays immediately
made, that the nomination be unanimous
was not offered; but after an adjournment a resolution
was adopted that inasmuch as Van Buren
had received the votes of two thirds of the delegates,
the convention unanimously concur "in recommending
him to the people of the United States
for their support."</p>

<p>No platform was adopted. A committee was
appointed after the nomination to draft an address;
but after a night's work they reported that, although
"agreeing fully in the principles and sentiments
which they believe ought to be embodied in
an address of this description, if such an address
were to be made," it still seemed better to them
that the convention recommend the several delegations
"to make such explanations by address, report,
or otherwise to their respective constituents
of the objects, proceedings, and result of the meeting
as they may deem expedient." This was a
franker intimation than those to which we are now
used, that the battle was to be fought in each State
upon the issue best suited to its local sentiments;
and was entitled to quite as much respect as mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>ingless
platitudes adopted lest one State or another
be offended at something explicit. Jackson's firm
and successful foreign policy, his opposition to internal
improvements by the federal government,
his strong stand against nullification, his opposition
to the United States Bank,&mdash;for from the battle
over the re-charter, precipitated by Clay early in
1832 to embarrass Jackson, the latter had not
shrunk,&mdash;and above all Jackson himself, these
were the real planks of the platform. But the
party wanted the votes of Pennsylvania Jacksonians
who believed in the Bank and of western
Jacksonians who wished federal aid for roads and
canals. The great tariff debate was then going on
in Congress; and the subject seemed full of danger.
The election was like the usual English canvass
on a parliamentary dissolution. The country was
merely asked without specifications: Do you on
the whole like Jackson's administration?</p>

<p>There is no real ground for the supposition
that intrigue or coercion was necessary to procure
Van Buren's nomination. It was dictated by
the simplest and plainest political considerations.
Calhoun was in opposition. After Jackson, Van
Buren was clearly the most distinguished and the
ablest member of the administration party; he had
rendered it services of the highest order; he was
very popular in the most important State of New
York; he was abroad, suffering from what Irving
at the time truly called "a very short-sighted and
mean-spirited act of hostility." The affront had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
aroused a general feeling which would enable Van
Buren to strengthen the ticket. In his department
had been performed the most shining achievements
of the administration. To the politicians about
Jackson, and very shrewd men they were, Van
Buren's succession to Jackson promised a firmer,
abler continuance of the administration than that
of any other public man. Could he indeed have
stayed minister to England, he would have continued
a figure of the first distinction, free from
local and temporary animosities and embarrassments.
From that post he might perhaps, as did
a later Democratic statesman, most easily have
ascended to the presidency; the vice-presidency
would have been unnecessary to the final promotion.
But after the tremendous affront dealt him
by Calhoun and Clay, his tame return to private
life would seem fatal. He must re&euml;nter public
life. And no re&euml;ntry, it was plain, could be so
striking as a popular election to the second station
in the land, nominal though it was, and in taking
it to displace the very enemy who had been finally
responsible for the wrong done him.</p>

<p>A month after his return Van Buren formally
accepted the nomination. The committee of the
convention had assured him that if the great Republican
party continued faithful to its principles,
there was every reason to congratulate him and
their illustrious president that there was in reserve
for his wounded feelings a just and certain reparation.
Van Buren said in reply that previous to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
his departure from the United States his name
had been frequently mentioned for the vice-presidency;
but that he had uniformly declared himself
altogether unwilling to be considered a candidate,
and that to his friends, when opportunity offered,
he had given the grounds of his unwillingness.
All this was strictly true. He had become a candidate
for the presidential succession; and honorable
absence as minister to England secured a
better preparation than presence as vice-president
amidst the difficulties and suspicions of Washington.
But his position, he added, had since that
period been essentially changed by the circumstance
to which the committee had referred, and
to which, with some excess of modesty he said,
rather than to any superior fitness on his part, he
was bound to ascribe his nomination. He gratefully
received this spontaneous expression of confidence
and friendship from the delegated democracy
of the Union. He declared it to be fortunate for
the country that its public affairs were under the
direction of one who had an early and inflexible
devotion to republican principles and a moral courage
which distinguished him from all others. In
the conviction, he said, that on a faithful adherence
to these principles depended the stability and value
of our confederated system, he humbly hoped lay
his motive, rather than any other, for accepting
the nomination. This rather clumsy affectation of
humility would have been more disagreeable had
it not been closely associated with firm and manly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
expressions, and because it was so common a formality
in the political vernacular of the day. In
treating the people as the sovereign, there were
adopted the sort of rhetorical extravagances used
by attendants upon monarchs.</p>

<p>On October 4, 1832, Van Buren, upon an interrogation
by a committee of a meeting at Shocco
Springs, North Carolina, wrote a letter upon the
tariff. He said that he believed "the establishment
of commercial regulations with a view to the
encouragement of domestic products to be within
the constitutional power of Congress." But as to
what should be the character of the tariff he indulged
in the generalities of a man who has opinions
which he does not think it wise or timely to
exhibit. He did not wish to see the power of
Congress exercised with "oppressive inequality"
or "for the advantage of one section of the Union
at the expense of another." The approaching extinguishment
of the national debt presented an opportunity
for a "more equitable adjustment of the
tariff," an opportunity already embraced in the
tariff of 1832, whose spirit as "a conciliatory measure"
he trusted would be cherished by all who
preferred public to private interests. These vague
expressions would have fitted either a revenue
reformer or an extreme protectionist. Both disbelieved,
or said they did, in oppression and inequality.
With a bit of irony, perhaps unconscious, he
added that he had been thus "explicit" in the
statement of his sentiments that there might not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
be room for misapprehension of his views. He
did, however, in the letter approve "a reduction of
the revenue to the wants of the government," and
"a preference in encouragement given to such
manufactures as are essential to the national defense,
and its extension to others in proportion as
they are adapted to our country and of which the
raw material is produced by ourselves." The last
phrase probably hinted at Van Buren's position.
He believed in strictly limiting protective duties,
although he had voted for the tariff of 1828. But
he told Benton that he cast this vote in obedience
to the "<i>demos krateo</i>" principle, that is, because
his State required it. He again spoke strongly
against the policy of internal improvements, and
the "scrambles and combinations in Congress"
unavoidably resulting from them. He was "unreservedly
opposed" to a renewal of the charter of
the Bank, and equally opposed to nullification,
which involved, he believed, the "certain destruction
of the confederacy."</p>

<p>A few days later he wrote to a committee of
"democratic-republican young men" in New York
of the peculiar hatred and contumely visited upon
him. Invectives against other men, he said, were
at times suspended; but he had never enjoyed a
moment's respite since his first entrance into public
life. Many distinguished public men had, he
added, been seriously injured by favors from the
press; but there was scarcely an instance in which
the objects of its obloquy had not been raised in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
public estimation in exact proportion to the intensity
and duration of the abuse.</p>

<p>Both the letter from the Baltimore convention
and Van Buren's reply alluded to "diversity of
sentiments and interests," disagreements "as to
measures and men" among the Republicans. The
secession of Calhoun and the bitter hostility of his
friends seriously weakened the party. But against
this was to be set the Anti-Masonic movement
which drew far more largely from Jackson's opponents
than from his supporters, for Jackson was a
Mason of a high degree. This strange agitation
had now spread beyond New York, and secured the
support of really able men. Judge McLean of the
Supreme Court desired the Anti-Masonic nomination;
William Wirt, the famous and accomplished
Virginian, accepted it. John Quincy Adams would
probably have accepted it, had it been tendered
him. He wrote in his diary: "The dissolution of
the Masonic institution in the United States I believe
to be really more important to us and our
posterity than the question whether Mr. Clay or
General Jackson shall be the president." In New
York the National Republicans or Whigs, with the
eager and silly leaning of minority parties to political
absurdities or vagaries, united with the Anti-Masons,
among whom William H. Seward and
Thurlow Weed had become influential. In 1830
they had supported Francis Granger, the Anti-Masonic
candidate for governor. In 1832 the
Anti-Masons in New York nominated an electoral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
ticket headed by Chancellor Kent, whose bitter,
narrow, and unintelligent politics were in singular
contrast with his extraordinary legal equipment
and his professional and literary accomplishments,
and by John C. Spencer, lately in charge of the
prosecution of Morgan's abductors. If the ticket
were successful, its votes were to go to Wirt or
Clay, whichever they might serve to elect. Amos
Ellmaker of Pennsylvania was the Anti-Masonic
candidate for vice-president. In December, 1831,
Clay had been nominated for president with the
loud enthusiasm which politicians often mistake for
widespread conviction. John Sergeant of Pennsylvania
was the candidate for vice-president. The
Whig Convention made the Bank re-charter the
issue. The very ably conducted Young Men's
National Republican Convention, held at Washington
in May, 1832, gave Clay a noble greeting,
made pilgrimage to the tomb of Washington there
to seal their solemn promises, and adopted a clear
and brief platform for protection, for internal improvements
by the federal government, for the
binding force upon the co&ouml;rdinate branches of the
government of the Supreme Court's opinions as to
constitutional questions, not only in special cases
formally adjudged, but upon general principles,
and against the manner in which the West Indian
trade had been recovered. They declared that "indiscriminate
removal of public officers for a mere
difference of political opinion is a gross abuse of
power, corrupting the morals and dangerous to the
liberties of the people of this country."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Even more clearly than in the campaign of 1828
was the campaign of 1832 a legitimate political
battle upon plain issues. The tariff bill of 1832,
supported by both parties and approved by Jackson,
prevented the question of protection from
being an issue, however ready the Whigs might
be, and however unready the Democrats, to give
commercial restrictions a theoretical approval.
Except on the "spoils" question, the later opinion
of the United States has sustained the attitude of
Jackson's party and the popular verdict of 1832.
The verdict was clear enough. In spite of the
Anti-Masonic fury, the numerous secessions from
the Jacksonian ranks, and some alarming journalistic
defections, especially of the New York
"Courier and Enquirer" of James Watson Webb
and Mordecai M. Noah, the people of the United
States continued to believe in Jackson and the
principles for which he stood. Upon the popular
vote Jackson and Van Buren received 687,502
votes against 530,189 votes for Clay and Wirt
combined, a popular majority over both of 157,313.
In 1828 Jackson had had 647,276 votes and Adams
508,064, a popular majority of 139,212. The increase
in Jackson's popular majority over two candidates
instead of one was particularly significant
in the north and east. The majority in New York
rose from 5350 to 13,601. In Maine a minority
of 6806 became a majority of 6087. In New
Hampshire a minority of 3212 became a majority
of 6476. In Massachusetts a minority of 23,860<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
was reduced to 18,458. In Rhode Island and Connecticut
the minorities were reduced. In New Jersey
a minority of 1813 became a majority of 463.
The electoral vote was even more heavily against
Clay. He had but 49 votes to Jackson's 219.
Wirt had the 7 votes of Vermont, while South
Carolina, beginning to step out of the Union, gave
its 11 votes to John Floyd of Virginia. Clay carried
only Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
Delaware, a part of Maryland, and his own
affectionate Kentucky. Van Buren received for
vice-president the same electoral vote as Jackson,
except that the 30 votes of Pennsylvania went to
Wilkins, a Pennsylvanian. Sergeant had the same
49 votes as Clay, Ellmaker the 7 votes of Vermont,
and Henry Lee of Massachusetts the 11 votes of
South Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This popular triumph brought great glory to
Jackson's second inauguration. The glory was
soon afterwards made greater and almost universal
by his bold attack upon nullification, and by the
vigorous and ringing yet dignified and even pathetic
proclamation of January, 1833, drafted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
by Edward Livingston, in which the President commanded
obedience to the law and entreated for loyalty
to the Union. It could not be overlooked that
the treasonable attitude of South Carolina had
been taken by the portion of the Democratic party
hostile to Van Buren. In a peculiar way therefore
he shared in Jackson's prestige.</p>

<p>The election seemed to clarify some of the views
of the administration. They now dared to speak
more explicitly. On his way to the inauguration,
Van Buren, declining a dinner at Philadelphia,
recited with approval what he called Jackson's repeated
and earnest recommendations of "a reduction
of duties to the revenue standard." In his
second inaugural Jackson said that there should
be exercised "by the general government those
powers only that are clearly delegated." In his
message of December, 1833, he again spoke of
"the importance of abstaining from all appropriations
which are not absolutely required for the
public interests, and authorized by the powers
clearly delegated to the United States;" and this
he said with the more emphasis because under the
compromise tariff of 1833 a large decrease in revenue
was anticipated.</p>

<p>In September, 1833, was announced Jackson's
refusal longer to deposit the moneys of the government
with the Bank of the United States. It is
plain that the dangers of the proposed deposits
of the moneys in the state banks were not appreciated.
Van Buren at first opposed this so-called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
"removal of the deposits." Kendall tells of an
interview with the Vice-President not long after
his inauguration, and while he was a guest at the
White House. Van Buren then warmly remonstrated
against the continued agitation of the subject,
after the resolution of the lower House at the
last session that the government deposits were safe
with the banks. Kendall replied that so certain to
his mind was the success of the Whig party at the
next presidential election and the consequent re-charter
of the Bank, unless it were now stripped
of the power which the charge of the public moneys
gave it, that if the Bank were to retain the deposits
he should consider further opposition useless and
would lay down his pen, leaving to others this question
and all other politics. "I can live," he said
to the Vice-President, "under a corrupt despotism
as well as any other man by keeping out of its way,
which I shall certainly do." They parted in excitement.
A few weeks later Van Buren confessed to
Kendall, "I had never thought seriously upon the
deposit question until after my conversation with
you; I am now satisfied that you were right and I
was wrong." Kendall was sent to ascertain whether
suitable state banks would accept the deposits, and
on what terms. While in New York Van Buren,
with McLane lately transferred from the Treasury
to the State Department, called on him and proposed
that the order for the change in the government
depositories should take effect on the coming
first of January. The date being a month after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the meeting of Congress, the executive action would
seem less defiant; and in the mean time the friends
of the administration could be more effectually
united in support of the measure. Kendall yielded
to the proposition though against his judgment, and
wrote to the President in its favor. But Jackson
would not yield. Whether or not its first inspiration
came from Francis P. Blair or Kendall, the
removal of the deposits was peculiarly Jackson's
own deed. The government moneys should not be
left in the hands of the chief enemy of his administration,
to be loaned in its discretion, that it might
secure doubtful votes in Congress and the support
of presses pecuniarily weak. As the Bank's charter
would expire within three years, it was pointed out
that the government ought to prepare for it by withholding
further deposits and gradually drawing out
the moneys then on deposit. Van Buren's assent
was given, but probably with no enthusiasm. He
disliked the Bank heartily enough. The corrupting
danger of intrusting government moneys to a
single private corporation to loan in its discretion
was clear. But a system of "pet banks" through
the States was too slight an improvement, if an
improvement at all. And any change would at
least offend and alarm the richer classes. It is impossible
to say what effect upon the re-charter of
the Bank and the election of 1836 its continued
possession of the deposits would have had. Its
tremendous power over credits doubtless gave it
many votes of administration congressmen. Pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>sibly,
as Jackson and Blair feared, it might have
secured enough to pass a re-charter over a veto. If
it had been thus re-chartered, it may be doubtful
whether the blow to the prestige of the administration
might not have been serious enough to elect a
Whig in 1836. But it is not doubtful that Van
Buren, and not Jackson, was compelled to face the
political results of this heroic and imperfect measure.</p>

<p>Some financial disturbance took place in the
winter of 1833-1834, which was ascribed by the
Whigs to the gradual transfer of the government
moneys from the United States Bank and its numerous
branches to the state banks. For political
effect, this disturbance was greatly exaggerated.
Deputations visited Washington to bait Jackson.
Memorial after memorial enabled congressmen to
make friends by complimenting the enterprise and
beauty of various towns, and to depict the utter
misery to which all their industries had been
brought, solely by a gradual transference throughout
the United States of $10,000,000, from one
set of depositories to another. The removal, Webster
said, had produced a degree of evil that could
not be borne. "A tottering state of credit, cramped
means, loss of property and loss of employment,
doubts of the condition of others, doubts of their
own condition, constant fear of failures and new
explosions, and awful dread of the future"&mdash;all
these evils, "without hope of improvement or
change," had resulted from the removal. Clay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
was more precise in his absurdity. The property
of the country had been reduced, he declared, four
hundred millions in value. Addressing Van Buren
in the Vice-President's chair, he begged him in a
burst of bathos to repair to the executive mansion
and place before the chief magistrate the naked
and undisguised truth. "Go to him," he cried,
"and tell him without exaggeration, but in the
language of truth and sincerity, the actual condition
of this bleeding country, ... of the tears
of helpless widows no longer able to earn their
bread, and of unclad and unfed orphans." Van
Buren, in the story often quoted from Benton, while
thus apostrophized, looked respectfully and innocently
at Clay, as if treasuring up every word to
be faithfully borne to the President; and when
Clay had finished, he called a senator to the chair,
went up to the eloquent and languishing Kentuckian,
asked him for a pinch of his fine maccoboy
snuff, and walked away. But this frivolity
was not fancied everywhere. At a meeting in
Philadelphia it was resolved "that Martin Van
Buren deserves and will receive the execrations of
all good men, should he shrink from the responsibility
of conveying to Andrew Jackson the message
sent by the Honorable Henry Clay." The whole
agitation was hollow enough. Jackson was not far
wrong in saying in his letter to Hamilton of January
2, 1834: "There is no real general distress.
It is only with those who live by borrowing, trade
or loans, and the gamblers in stocks." The busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>ness
of the country was not injured by refusing to
let Nicholas Biddle and his subordinates, rather
than other men, lend for gain ten millions of government
money. But business was soon to be injured
by permitting the state banks to do the same
thing. The change did not, as Jackson thought,
"leave all to trade on their own credit and capital
without any interference by the general government
except using its powers by giving through its mint
a specie currency."</p>

<p>Van Buren took a permanent residence in Washington
after his inauguration as vice-president. He
now held a rank accorded to no other vice-president
before or since. He was openly adopted by the
American Augustus, and seemed already to wear
the title of C&aelig;sar. As no other vice-president has
been, he was the chief adviser of the President,
and as much the second officer of the government
in power as in the dignity of his station. His
only chance of promotion did not lie in the President's
death. That the President should live until
after the election of 1836 was safely over, Van
Buren had every selfish motive as well as many
generous motives to desire. His ambition was no-wise
disagreeable to his chief. To see that ambition
satisfied would gratify both patriotic and
personal wishes of the tempestuous but not erratic
old man in the White House. For there was
the utmost intimacy and confidence between the
two men. Van Buren had every reason, personal,
political, and patriotic, to desire the entire suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>cess
of the administration. He was not only the
second member of it; but in his jealous and anxious
watch over it he was preserving his own patrimony.
His ability and experience were far
greater than those of any other of its members.
After Taney had been transferred from the attorney-general's
office to the Treasury, in September,
1833, to make the transfer of the deposits, Jackson
appointed Benjamin F. Butler, Van Buren's intimate
friend, his former pupil and partner, to Taney's
place. Louis McLane, Van Buren's predecessor
in the mission to England, and his successor,
after Edward Livingston, in the State Department,
resigned the latter office in the summer of 1834.
He had disapproved Jackson's removal of the deposits;
he believed it would be unpopular, and the
presidential bee was buzzing in his bonnet. John
Forsyth of Georgia, an admirer of Van Buren, and
one of his defenders in the senatorial debate at
the time of his rejection, then took the first place
in the cabinet. Van Buren accompanied Jackson
during part of the latter's visit to the Northeast
in the summer of 1833, when as the adversary of
nullification his popularity was at its highest, so
high indeed that Harvard College, to Adams's
disgust, made him a Doctor of Laws. But the
exciting events of Jackson's second term hardly
belong, with the information we yet have, to Van
Buren's biography. They have been often and
admirably told in the lives of Jackson and Clay,
the seeming chiefs on the two sides of the long
encounter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Buren's nomination for the presidency, bitter
as the opposition to it still was, came as matter
of course. The large and serious secession of Calhoun
and his followers from the Jacksonian party
was followed by the later and more serious defection
of the Democrats who made a rival Democratic
candidate of Hugh L. White, a senator
from Tennessee, and formerly a warm friend and
adherent of Jackson. It was in White's behalf
that Davy Crockett wrote, in 1835, his entertaining
though scurrilous life of Van Buren. Jackson's
friendship for Van Buren, Crockett said, had
arisen from his hatred to Calhoun, of which Van
Buren, who was "secret, sly, selfish, cold, calculating,
distrustful, treacherous," had taken advantage.
Jackson was now about to give up "an old, long-tried,
faithful friend, Judge White, who stuck to
him through all his tribulations, helped to raise
his fortunes from the beginning; adventurers together
in a new country, friends in youth and in
old age, fought together in the same battles, risked
the same dangers, starved together in the same
deserts, merely to gratify this revengeful feeling."
Van Buren was "as opposite to General Jackson
as dung is to a diamond."</p>

<p>It is difficult to find any justification for White's
candidacy. He was a modest, dignified senator
whose popularity in the Democratic Southwest rendered
him available to Van Buren's enemies. But
neither his abilities nor his services to the public
or his party would have suggested him for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the presidency. Doubtless in him as with other
modest, dignified men in history, there burned ambition
whose fire never burst into flame, and which
perhaps for its suppression was the more troublesome.
He consented, apparently only for personal
reasons, to head the Southern schism from Jackson
and Van Buren; and in his political destruction
he paid the penalty usually and justly visited upon
statesmen who, through personal hatred or jealousy
or ambition, break party ties without a real difference
of principle. Benton said that White consented
to run "because in his advanced age he did
the act which, with all old men, is an experiment,
and with most of them an unlucky one. He married
again; and this new wife having made an
immense stride from the head of a boarding-house
table to the head of a senator's table, could see no
reason why she should not take one step more, and
that comparatively short, and arrive at the head of
the presidential table."</p>

<p>The Democratic-Republican Convention met at
Baltimore on May 20, 1835, nearly eighteen months
before the election. There were over five hundred
delegates from twenty-three States. South Carolina,
Alabama, and Illinois were not represented.
Party organization was still very imperfect. The
modern system of precise and proportional representations
was not yet known. The States which
approved the convention sent delegates in such
number as suited their convenience. Maryland,
the convention being held in its chief city, sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
183 delegates; Virginia, close at hand, sent 102;
New York, although the home of the proposed
candidate, sent but 42, the precise number of its
electoral votes. Tennessee sent but one; Mississippi
and Missouri, only two each. In making
the nominations, the delegates from each State,
however numerous or few, cast a number of votes
equal to its representation in the electoral college.
The 183 delegates from Maryland cast therefore
but ten votes; while the single delegate from Tennessee,
much courted man that he must have been,
cast 15.</p>

<p>It was the second national convention of the
party. The members assembled at the "place of
worship of the Fourth Presbyterian Church." Instead
of the firm and now long-recognized opening
by the chairman of the national committee provided
by the well-geared machinery of our later politics,
George Kremer of Pennsylvania first "stated
the objects of the meeting." Andrew Stevenson of
Virginia, the president, felt it necessary in his
opening speech to defend the still novel party institution.
Efforts, he said, would be made at the
approaching election to divide the Republican party
and possibly to defeat an election by the people in
their primary colleges. Their venerable president
had advised, but in vain, constitutional amendments
securing this election to the people, and preventing
its falling to the House of Representatives. A
national convention was the best means of concentrating
the popular will, the only defense against a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
minority party. It was recommended by prudence,
sanctioned by the precedent of 1832, and had
proved effectual by experience. They must guard
against local jealousies. "What, gentlemen," he
said, "would you think of the sagacity and prudence
of that individual who would propose the expedient
of cutting up the noble ship that each man might
seize his own plank and steer for himself?" The inquiries
must be: Who can best preserve the unity
of the Democratic party? Who best understands
the principles and motives of our government?
Who will carry out the principles of the Jeffersonian
era and General Jackson's administration?
These demands clearly enough pointed out Van
Buren. Prayers were then offered up "in a fervent,
feeling manner." The rule requiring two
thirds of the whole number of votes for a nomination
was again adopted, because "it would have
a more imposing effect," though nearly half the
convention, 210 to 231, thought a majority was
more "according to Democratic principles." Niles
records that the formal motion to proceed to the
nomination caused a smile among the members, so
well settled was it that Van Buren was to be the
nominee. He received the unanimous vote of the
convention. A strong fight was made for the vice-presidency
between the friends of Richard M.
Johnson of Kentucky and William C. Rives of
Virginia. The former received barely the two-thirds
vote. The Virginia delegation upon the
defeat of the latter did what would now be a sac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>rilegious
laying of violent hands on the ark. Party
regularity was not yet so chief a deity in the political
temple. The Virginians had, they said, an
unpleasant duty to perform; but they would not
shrink from it. They would not support Johnson
for the vice-presidency; they had no confidence in
his principles or his character; they had come to
the convention to support principles, not men;
they had already gone as far as possible in supporting
Mr. Van Buren, and they would not go further.
Not long afterwards Rives left the party. No platform
was adopted; but a committee was appointed
to prepare an address to the people.</p>

<p>The Whigs nominated General William Henry
Harrison for the presidency and Francis Granger
for the vice-presidency. They had but a forlorn
hope of direct success. But the secession from
the Democratic party of the nullifiers, and the more
serious secession in the Southwest headed by White,
made it seem possible to throw the election into
the House. John Tyler of Virginia was the nominee
of the bolting Democrats, for vice-president
upon the ticket with White. The Whigs of Massachusetts
preferred their unequaled orator; for
they then and afterwards failed to see, as the admirers
of some other famous Americans have failed
to see, that other qualities make a truer equipment
for the first office of the land than this noble art
of oratory. South Carolina would vote against
Calhoun's victorious adversary; but she would not,
in the first instance at least, vote with the Whig
heretics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a disorderly campaign, lasting a year and
a half, and never reaching the supreme excitement
of 1840 or 1844. The opposition did not deserve
success. It had neither political principle nor discipline.
Calhoun described the Van Buren men
as "a powerful faction (party it cannot be called)
held together by the hopes of public plunder and
marching under a banner whereon is written 'to
the victors belong the spoils.'" There was in the
rhetorical exaggeration enough truth perhaps to
make an issue. But the political removals under
Jackson were only incidentally touched in the canvass.
Amos Kendall, then postmaster-general, towards
the close of the canvass wrote a letter which,
coming from perhaps the worst of Jackson's "spoils-men,"
shows how far public sentiment was even
then from justifying the political interference of
federal officers in elections. Samuel McKean, senator
from Pennsylvania, had written to Kendall
complaining that three employees of the post-office
had used the time and influence of their official
stations to affect elections, by written communications
and personal importunities. This, he said,
was "a loathsome public nuisance," though admitting
that since Kendall became postmaster-general
he had given no cause of complaint. Kendall replied
on September 27, 1836, that though it was
difficult to draw the line between the rights of the
citizen and the assumptions of the officeholder, he
thought it dangerous to our institutions that government
employees should "assume to direct public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
opinion and control the results of elections in the
general or state government." His advice to members
of his department was to keep as clear from
political strife as possible, "to shun mere political
meetings, or, if present, to avoid taking any part
in their proceedings, to decline acting as members
of political committees or conventions." In making
appointments he would prefer political friends; but
he "would not remove a good postmaster and honest
man for a mere difference of political opinion."
The complaints were for offenses committed under
his predecessor; one of the three offenders had
left the service; the other two had been free from
criticism for seventeen months. There can be little
doubt that the standard thus set up in public was
higher than the general practice of Kendall or his
subordinates; but the letter showed that public
sentiment had not yet grown callous to this odious
abuse.</p>

<p>Jackson did not permit the presidential office to
restrain him from most vigorous and direct advocacy
of Van Buren's claims. He begged Tennessee not
to throw herself "into the embraces of the Federalists,
the Nullifiers, or the new-born Whigs." They
were living, he said, in evil times, when political
apostasy had become frequent, when public men
(referring to White, John Tyler, and others who
had gone with them) were abandoning principle
and their party attachment for selfish ends. To
this it was replied that the president's memory was
treacherous; that he had forgotten his early friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and listened only "to the voice of flattery and the
siren voice of sycophancy." The dissenting Republicans
affected to support administration measures,
but protested against Jackson's dictating the succession.
They were then, they said, "what they
were in 1828,&mdash;Jacksonians following the creed
of that apostle of liberty, Thomas Jefferson."</p>

<p>Without principle as was this formidable secession,
it is impossible to feel much more respect for
the declaration of principles made for the Whig
candidates. Clay, the chief spokesman, complained
that Jackson had killed with the pocket veto the
land bill, which proposed to distribute the proceeds
of the sales of public lands among the States according
to their federal population (which in the
South included three fifths of the slaves), to be used
for internal improvements, education, or other purposes.
He pointed out, with "mixed feelings of
pity and ridicule," that the few votes in the Senate
against the "deposit bill," which was to distribute
the surplus among the States, had been cast by
administration senators, since deserted by their
numerous followers who demanded distribution.
He rejoiced that Kentucky was to get a million
and a half from the federal treasury. He denounced
Jackson's "tampering with the currency"
by the treasury order requiring public lands to be
paid for in specie and not in bank-notes. Jackson's
treatment of the Cherokees seemed the only
point of attack apart from his financial policy.</p>

<p>The real party platforms this year were curiously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
found in letters of the candidates to Sherrod Williams,
an individual by no means distinguished.
On April 7, 1836, he addressed a circular letter to
Harrison, Van Buren, and White, asking each of
them his opinions on five points: Did he approve
a distribution of the surplus revenue among the
States according to their federal population, for
such uses as they might appoint? Did he approve
a like distribution of the proceeds of the sales of
public lands? Did he approve federal appropriations
to improve navigable streams above ports of
entry? Did he approve another bank charter, if it
should become necessary to preserve the revenue
and finances of the nation? Did he believe it constitutional
to expunge from the records of a house
of Congress any of its proceedings? The last
question referred to Benton's agitation for a resolution
expunging from the records of the Senate
the resolution of 1834, condemning Jackson's removal
of the deposits as a violation of the Constitution.
Harrison, for whose benefit the questions
were put, returned what was supposed to be the
popular affirmative to the first three inquiries.
The fourth he answered in the affirmative, and the
fifth in the negative. Van Buren promptly pointed
out to Williams that he doubted the right of an
elector, who had already determined to oppose him,
to put inquiries "with the sole view of exposing,
at his own time and the mode he may select, the
opinions of the candidate to unfriendly criticism,"
but nevertheless promised a reply after Congress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
had risen. This delay he deemed proper, because
during the session he might, as president of the
Senate, have to vote upon some of the questions.
Williams replied that the excuse for delay was
"wholly and entirely unsatisfactory." Van Buren
curtly said that he should wait as he had stated.
On August 8, not far from the time nowadays
selected by presidential candidates for their letters
of acceptance, Van Buren addressed a letter to
Williams, the prolixity of which seems a fault, but
which, when newspapers were fewer and shorter,
and reading was less multifarious, secured perhaps,
from its length, a more ample and deliberate study
from the masses of the people.</p>

<p>For clearness and explicitness, and for cogency
of argument, this letter has few equals among those
written by presidential candidates. This most conspicuous
of Van Buren's pre&euml;lection utterances has
been curiously ignored by those who have accused
him of "non-committalism." Congress, he said,
does not possess the power under the Constitution
to raise money for distribution among the States.
If a distinction were justifiable, and of this he was
not satisfied, between raising money for such a
purpose and the distribution of an unexpected
surplus, then the distribution ought not to be attempted
without previous amendment of the Constitution.
Any system of distribution must introduce
vices into both the state and federal governments.
It would be a great misfortune if the distribution
bill already passed should be deemed a pledge of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
like legislation in the future. So much of the
letter has since largely had the approval of American
sentiment, and was only too soon emphasized
by the miserable results of the bill thus condemned.
The utterance was clear and wise; and it was far
more. It was a singularly bold attitude to assume,
not only against the views of the opposition, but
against a measure passed by Van Buren's own
party friends and signed by Jackson, a measure
having a vast and cheap popularity throughout the
States which were supposed, and with too much
truth, not to see that for what they took out of the
federal treasury they would simply have to put so
much more in. "I hope and believe," said Van
Buren, "that the public voice will demand that
this species of legislation shall terminate with the
emergency that produced it." To the inquiry
whether he would approve a distribution among
the States of the proceeds of selling the public
lands, Van Buren plainly said that if he were
elected he would not favor the policy. These
moneys, he declared, should be applied "to the
general wants of the treasury." To the inquiry
whether he would approve appropriations to improve
rivers above ports of entry, he quoted with
approval Jackson's declaration in the negative.
He would not go beyond expenditures for lighthouses,
buoys, beacons, piers, and the removal
of obstructions in rivers and harbors below such
ports.</p>

<p>Upon the bank question, too, he left his in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>terrogator
in no doubt. If the people wished a
national bank as a permanent branch of their institutions,
or if they desired a chief magistrate who
as to that would consider it his duty to watch the
course of events and give or withhold his assent
according to the supposed necessity, then another
than himself must be chosen. And he added: "If,
on the other hand, with this seasonable, explicit,
and published avowal before them, a majority of
the people of the United States shall nevertheless
bestow upon me their suffrages for the office of
president, skepticism itself must cease to doubt,
and admit their will to be that there shall not be
any Bank of the United States until the people, in
the exercise of their sovereign authority, see fit to
give to Congress the right to establish one." It
was high time "that the federal government confine
itself to the creation of coin, and that the
States afford it a fair chance for circulation."
With the power of either house of Congress to
expunge from its records, he pointed out that the
President could have no concern. But rather than
avoid an answer, he said that he regarded the passage
of Colonel Benton's resolution as "an act of
justice to a faithful and greatly injured public
servant, not only constitutional in itself, but imperiously
demanded by a proper respect for the
well-known will of the people."</p>

<p>This justly famous letter made up for the rather
jejune and conventional letter of acceptance written
a year before. Not concealing his sensitiveness to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the charge of intrigue and management, Van Buren
had then appealed to the members of the Democratic
convention, to the "editors and politicians
throughout the Union" who had preferred him, to
his "private correspondents and intimate friends,"
and to those, once his "friends and associates,
whom the fluctuations of political life" had "converted
into opponents." No man, he declared,
could truly say that he had solicited political support,
or entered or sought to enter into any arrangement
to procure him the nomination he had now
received, or to elevate him to the chief magistracy.
There was no public question of interest upon
which his opinions had not been made known by
his official acts, his own public avowals, and the
authorized explanations of his friends. The last
was a touch of the frankness which Van Buren
used in vain to stop his enemies' accusations of
indirectness. Instead of shielding himself, as public
men usually and naturally do, behind Butler,
the attorney-general, and others who had spoken
for him, he directly assumed responsibility for their
"explanations." He considered himself selected
to carry out the principles and policy of Jackson's
administration, "happy," he said, "if I shall be
able to perfect the work which he has so gloriously
begun." He closed with the theoretical declaration
which consistently ran through his chief utterances,
that, though he would "exercise the powers
which of right belong to the general government
in a spirit of moderation and brotherly love," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
would on the other hand "religiously abstain from
the assumption of such as have not been delegated
by the Constitution."</p>

<p>Upon still another question Van Buren explicitly
declared himself before the election. In 1835,
the year of his nomination, appeared the cloud
like a man's hand which was not to leave the sky
until out of it had come a terrific, complete, and
beneficent convulsion. Then openly and seriously
began the work of the extreme anti-slavery men.
Clay pointed out in his speech on colonization in
1836 that "this fanatical class" of abolitionists
"were none of your old-fashioned gradual emancipationists,
such as Franklin, Rush, and the other
wise and benevolent Pennsylvanians who framed
the scheme for the gradual removal of slavery."
He was right. Many of the new abolitionists were
on the verge, or beyond it, of quiet respectability.
Educated, intelligent, and even wealthy as some of
them were, the abolitionists did not belong to the
always popular class of well-to-do folks content
with the institutions of society. Most virtuous and
religious people saw in them only wicked disturbers
of the peace. All the comfortable, philosophical
opponents of slavery believed that such wild and
reckless agitators would, if encouraged, prostrate
the pillars of civilization, and bring on anarchy,
bloodshed, and servile wars worse even to the slaves
than the wrongs of their slavery. But to the members
of the abolition societies which now rose, this
was no abstract or economical question. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
were undaunted by the examples of Washington
and Jefferson and Patrick Henry, who, whatever
they said or hoped against slavery, nevertheless
held human beings in bondage; or of Adams and
other Northern adherents of the Constitution, who
for a season at least had joined in a pact to protect
the infamous slave traffic. To them, talk of
the sacred Union, or of the great advance which
negroes had made in slavery and would not have
made in freedom, was idle. With unquenched
vision they saw the horrid picture of the individual
slave life, not the general features of slavery; they
saw the chain, the lash, the brutalizing and contrived
ignorance; they saw the tearing apart of
families, with their love and hope, precisely like
those of white men and women, crushed out by
detestable cruelty; they saw the beastly dissoluteness
inevitable to the plantation system. Nor
would they be still, whatever the calm preaching
of political wisdom, whatever the sincere and
weighty insolence of men of wisdom and uprightness
and property. Northern men of 1888 must
look with a real shame upon the behavior of
their fathers and grandfathers towards the narrow,
fiery, sometimes almost hateful, apostles of human
rights; and with even greater shame upon the talk
of the sacred right of white men to make brutes of
black men, a right to be treated, as the best of
Americans were so fond of saying, with a tender
and affectionate regard for the feelings of the
white slave-masters. About the same time began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the continual presentation to Congress of petitions
for the abolition of slavery, and the foolish but
Heaven-ordained attack of slaveholders on the right
of petition. The agitation rapidly flaming up was
far different from the practical and truly political
discussion over the Missouri Compromise fifteen
years before.</p>

<p>As yet, indeed, the matter was not politically
important, except in the attack upon Van Buren
made by the Southern members of his party. Sixteen
years before, he had voted against admitting
more slave States. He had aided the re&euml;lection of
Rufus King, a determined enemy of slavery. He
had strongly opposed Calhoun and the Southern
nullifiers. In the "Evening Post" and the "Plain-dealer"
of New York appeared from 1835 to 1837
the really noble series of editorials by William
Leggett, strongly proclaiming the right of free
discussion and the essential wrong of slavery; although
sometimes he condemned the fanaticism
now aroused as "a species of insanity." The
"Post" strongly supported Van Buren, and was
declared at the South to be his chosen organ for
addressing the public. It denied, however, that
Van Buren had any "connection in any way or
shape with the doctrines or movements of the abolitionists."
But such denials were widely disbelieved
by the slaveholders. It was declared that
he had a deep agency in the Missouri question
which fixed upon him a support of abolition; his
denials were answered by the anti-slavery petitions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
from twenty thousand memorialists in his own State
of New York, and by the support brought him by
the enemies of slavery. To all this the Whig
"dough-faces" listened with entire satisfaction.
They must succeed, if at all, through Southern distrust
or dislike of Van Buren. In July, 1834, he
had publicly written to Samuel Gwin of Mississippi
that his opinions upon the power of Congress over
slave property in the Southern States were so well
understood by his friends that he was surprised
that an attempt should be made to deceive the
public about them; that slavery was in his judgment
"exclusively under the control of the state
governments;" that no "contrary opinion to an
extent deserving consideration" was entertained in
any part of the United States; and that, without a
change of the Constitution, no interference with it
in a State could be had "even at the instance of
either or of all the slaveholding States." But, it
was said, "Tappan, Garrison, and every other fanatic
and abolitionist in the United States not entirely
run mad, will grant that." And, indeed,
Abraham Lincoln was nominated twenty-four years
later upon a like declaration of "the right of each
State to order and control its own domestic institutions
according to its own judgment exclusively."</p>

<p>The District of Columbia, however, was one bit
of territory in which Congress doubtless had the
power to abolish slavery. In our better days it
would seem to have been a natural enough impulse
to seek to make free soil at least of the capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
of the land of freedom. But the District lay between
and was completely surrounded by two slave
States. Washington had derived its laws and
customs from Maryland. If the District were
free while Virginia and Maryland were slave, it
was feared with much reason that there would
arise most dangerous collisions. Its perpetual
slavery was an unforeseen part of the price Alexander
Hamilton had paid to procure the federal
assumption of the war debts of the States. In
Van Buren's time there was almost complete
acquiescence in the proposition that, though slavery
had in the District no constitutional protection,
it must still be deemed there a part of the
institution in Virginia and Maryland. How clear
was the understanding may be seen from language
of undoubted authority. John Quincy Adams had
hitherto labored for causes which have but cold
and formal interest to posterity. But now, leaving
the field of statesmanship, where his glory
had been meagre, and, fortunately for his reputation,
with the shackles of its responsibility no
longer upon him, the generous and exalted love of
humanity began to touch his later years with the
abiding splendor of heroic and far-seeing courage.
He became the first of the great anti-slavery leaders.
He entered for all time the group of men,
Garrison, Lovejoy, Giddings, Phillips, Sumner,
and Beecher, to whom so largely we owe the
second and nobler salvation of our land. But
Adams was emphatically opposed to the abolition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of slavery in the District. In December, 1831,
the first month of his service in the House, on
presenting a petition for such abolition, he declared
that he should not support it. In February,
1837, a few days before Van Buren's inauguration,
there occurred the scene when Adams,
with grim and dauntless irony, brought to the
House the petition of some slaves against abolition.
In his speech then he said: "From the day I
entered this House down to the present moment,
I have invariably here, and invariably elsewhere,
declared my opinions to be adverse to the prayer
of petitions which call for the abolition of slavery
in the District of Columbia."</p>

<p>It is a curious but inevitable impeachment of
the impartiality of history that for a declaration
precisely the same as that made by a great and
recognized apostle of anti-slavery, and made by
that apostle in a later year, Van Buren has been
denounced as a truckler to the South, a "Northern
man with Southern principles." Van Buren's declaration
was made, not like Adams's in the easy
freedom of an independent member of Congress
from an anti-slavery district, but under the constraint
of a presidential nomination partially coming
from the South. In the canvass before his
election, Van Buren gave perfectly fair notice of
his intention. "I must go," he said, "into the
presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising
opponent of every attempt on the part of
Congress to abolish slavery in the District of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Columbia against the wishes of the slaveholding
States." This was the attitude, not only of Van
Buren and Adams, but of every statesman North
and South, and of the entire North itself with
insignificant exceptions. The former's explicit
declaration was doubtless aimed at the pro-slavery
jealousy stirred up against himself in the South;
it was intended to have political effect. But it
was none the less the unambiguous expression of
an opinion sincerely shared with the practically
unanimous sense of the country.</p>

<p>A skillful effort was made to embarrass Van
Buren with his Southern supporters over a more
difficult question. The anti-slavery societies at
the North sought to circulate their literature at
the South. So strong an enemy of slavery as
William Leggett condemned this as "fanatical
obstinacy," obviously tending to stir up at the
South insurrections, whose end no one could foresee,
and as the fruit of desperation and extravagance.
The Southern States by severe laws forbade
the circulation of the literature. Its receipts
from Southern post-offices led to great excitement
and even violence. In August, 1835, Kendall, the
postmaster-general, was appealed to by the postmaster
at Charleston, South Carolina, for advice
whether he should distribute papers "inflammatory,
and incendiary, and insurrectionary in the
highest degree," papers whose very custody endangered
the mail. Kendall, in an extraordinary
letter, said that he had no legal authority to pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>hibit
the delivery of papers on account of their
character, but that he was not prepared to direct
the delivery at Charleston of papers such as were
described. Gouverneur, the postmaster at New
York, being then appealed to by his Charleston
brother, declined to forward papers mailed by the
American Anti-Slavery Society. This dangerous
usurpation was defended upon the principle of
<i>salus populi suprema lex</i>.</p>

<p>In December, 1835, Jackson called the attention
of Congress to the circulation of "inflammatory
appeals addressed to the passions of the slaves"
(as they used to call the desire of black men to be
free), "calculated to stimulate them to insurrection
and produce all the horrors of a servile war." A
bill was introduced making it unlawful for any
postmaster knowingly to deliver any printed or
pictorial paper touching the subject of slavery
in States by whose laws their circulation was prohibited.
Webster condemned the bill as a federal
violation of the freedom of the press. Clay
thought it unconstitutional, vague, indefinite, and
unnecessary, as the States could lay hold of citizens
taking such publications from post-offices
within their borders. Benton and other senators,
several of them Democrats, and seven from slaveholding
States, voted against the bill, because they
were, so Benton said, "tired of the eternal cry of
dissolving the Union, did not believe in it, and
would not give a repugnant vote to avoid the
trial." The debate did not reach a very exalted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
height. The question was by no means free from
doubt. Anti-slavery papers probably were, as the
Southerners said, "incendiary" to their States.
Slavery depended upon ignorance and fear. The
federal post-office no doubt was intended, as Kendall
argued, to be a convenience to the various
States, and not an offense against their codes of
morality. There has been little opposition to the
present prohibition of the use of the post-office for
obscene literature, or, to take a better illustration,
for the circulars of lotteries which are lawful in
some States but not in others.</p>

<p>When the bill came to a vote in the Senate,
although there was really a substantial majority
against it, a tie was skillfully arranged to compel
Van Buren, as Vice-President, to give the casting
vote. White, the Southern Democratic candidate
so seriously menacing him, was in the Senate, and
voted for the bill. Van Buren must, it was supposed,
offend the pro-slavery men by voting against
the bill, or offend the North and perhaps bruise
his conscience by voting for it. When the roll
was being called, Van Buren, so Benton tells us,
was out of the chair, walking behind the colonnade
at the rear of the vice-president's seat. Calhoun,
fearful lest he might escape the ordeal, eagerly
asked where he was, and told the sergeant-at-arms
to look for him. But Van Buren was ready, and
at once stepped to his chair and voted for the bill.
His close friend, Silas Wright of New York, also
voted for it. Benton says he deemed both the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
votes to be political and given from policy. So
they probably were. To Van Buren all the fire-eating
measures of Calhoun and the pro-slavery
men were most distasteful. He probably thought
the bill would do more to increase than allay agitation
at the North. Walter Scott, when the prince
regent toasted him as the author of "Waverley,"
feeling that even royal highness had no right in
a numerous company to tear away the long kept
and valuable secrecy of "the great Unknown," rose
and gravely said to his host: "Sire, I am not the
author of 'Waverley.'" There were, he thought,
questions which did not entitle the questioner to
be told the truth. So Van Buren may have
thought there were political interrogations which,
being made for sheer party purposes, might rightfully
be answered for like purposes. Since the
necessity for his vote was contrived to injure him
and not to help or hurt the bill, he probably felt
justified so to vote as best to frustrate the design
against him. This persuasive casuistry usually
overcomes a candidate for great office in the stress
of conflict. But lenient as may be the judgment
of party supporters, and distressing as may seem
the necessity, the untruth pretty surely returns to
plague the statesman. Van Buren never deserved
to be called a "Northern man with Southern principles."
But this vote came nearer to an excuse
for the epithet than did any other act of his career.</p>

<p>The election proved how large was the Southern
defection. Georgia and Tennessee, which had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
almost unanimous for Jackson in 1836, now voted
for White. Mississippi, where in that year there
had been no opposition, and Louisiana, where
Jackson had eight votes to Clay's five, now gave
Van Buren majorities of but three hundred each.
In North Carolina Jackson had had 24,862 votes,
and Clay only 4563; White got 23,626 to 26,910
for Van Buren. In Virginia Jackson had three
times the vote of Clay; Van Buren had but one
fourth more votes than White. In Benton's own
State, so nearly unanimous for Jackson, White
had over 7000 to Van Buren's 11,000. But in
the Northeast Van Buren was very strong. Jackson's
majority in Maine of 6087 became a majority
of 7751 for Van Buren. New Hampshire, the
home of Hill and Woodbury, had given Jackson
a majority of 6376; it gave Van Buren over
12,000. The Democratic majority in New York
rose from less than 14,000 to more than 28,000,
and this majority was rural and not urban. The
majority in New York city was but about 1000.
Of the fifty-six counties, Van Buren carried
forty-two, while nowadays his political successors
rarely carry more than twenty. Connecticut had
given a majority of 6000 for Clay; it gave Van
Buren over 500. Rhode Island had voted for
Clay; it now voted for Van Buren. Massachusetts
was carried for Webster by 42,247 against
34,474 for Van Buren; Clay had had 33,003 to
only 14,545 for Jackson. But New Jersey shifted
from Jackson to Harrison, although a very close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
State at both elections; and in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, Van Buren fell far
behind Jackson. The popular vote, omitting South
Carolina, where the legislature chose the electors,
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Van Buren thus came to the presidency supported
by the great Middle States and New England
against the West, with the South divided.
Omitting the uncontested re&euml;lection of Monroe in
1820, and the almost uncontested re&euml;lection of
Jefferson in 1804, Van Buren was the first Democratic
candidate for president who carried New
England. He had there a clear majority in both
the electoral and the popular vote. Nor has any
Democrat since Van Buren obtained a majority of
the popular vote in that strongly thinking and
strongly prejudiced community. Pierce, against
the feeble Whig candidacy of Scott, carried its
electoral vote in 1852, but by a minority of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
popular vote, and only because of the large Free
Soil vote for Hale. No other Democrat since 1852
has had any electoral vote from New England outside
of Connecticut. Virginia refused its vote to
Johnson, who, in the failure of either candidate to
receive a majority of the electoral vote, was chosen
vice-president by the Senate.</p>

<p>When the electoral votes were formally counted
before the houses of Congress, the result, so contemporary
record informs us, was "received with
perfect decorum by the House and galleries."
Enthusiasm was going out with Jackson, to come
back again with Harrison. Van Buren's election
was the success of intellectual convictions, and not
the triumph of sentiment. He had come to power,
as "the House and galleries" well knew, in "perfect
decorum." Not a single one of the generous
but sometimes cheap and fruitless rushes of feeling
occasionally so potent in politics had helped him
to the White House. Not that he was ungenerous
or lacking in feeling. Very far from it; few men
have inspired so steady and deep a political attachment
among men of strong character and patriotic
aspirations. But neither in his person nor in his
speech or conduct was there anything of the strong
picturesqueness which impresses masses of men,
who must be touched, if at all, by momentary
glimpses of great men or by vivid phrases which
become current about them. His election was no
more than a triumph of disciplined good sense and
political wisdom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="ft80">CRISIS OF 1837</span></h2>


<p>On March 4, 1837, Jackson and Van Buren
rode together from the White House to the Capitol
in a "beautiful pha&euml;ton" made from the timber of
the old frigate Constitution, the gift to the general
from the Democrats of New York city. He was
the third and last president who has, after serving
through his term, left office amid the same enthusiasm
which attended him when he entered
it, and to whom the surrender of place has not
been full of those pangs which attend sudden loss
of power, and of which the certain anticipation
ought to moderate ambition in a country so rarely
permitting a long and continuous public career.
Washington, amid an almost unanimous love and
reverence, left a station of which he was unaffectedly
weary; and he was greater out of office than in
it. Jefferson and Jackson remained really powerful
characters. Neither at Monticello nor at the
Hermitage, after their masters had returned, was
there any lack of the incense of sincere popular
flattery or of the appeals for the exercise of admitted
and enormous influence, in which lies much of
the unspeakable fascination of a great public station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving the White House under a still and brilliant
sky, the retiring and incoming rulers had such
a popular and military attendance as without much
order or splendor has usually gone up Capitol Hill
with our presidents. Van Buren's inaugural speech
was heard, it is said, by nearly twenty thousand
persons; for he read it with remarkable distinctness
and in a quiet air, from the historic eastern portico.
He returned from the inauguration to his private
residence; and with a fine deference insisted upon
Jackson remaining in the White House until his
departure, a few days later, for Tennessee. Van
Buren in his own carriage took Jackson to the
terminus of the new railway upon which the journey
home was to begin. He bade the old man a most
affectionate farewell, and promised to visit him at
the Hermitage in the summer.</p>

<p>The new cabinet, with a single exception, was
the same as Jackson's: John Forsyth of Georgia,
secretary of state; Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire,
secretary of the treasury; Mahlon Dickerson
of New Jersey, secretary of the navy; Kendall,
postmaster-general; and Butler, attorney-general.
Joel R. Poinsett, a strong union man among the
nullifiers of South Carolina, became secretary of
war. Cass had left this place in 1836 to be minister
to France, and Butler had since temporarily
filled it, as well as his own post of attorney-general.
The cabinet had indeed been largely Van Buren's,
two years and more before he was president.</p>

<p>Van Buren's inaugural address began again with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the favorite touch of humility, but it now had an
agreeable dignity. He was, he said, the first president
born after the Revolution; he belonged to a
later age than his illustrious predecessors. Nor
ought he to expect his countrymen to weigh his
actions with the same kind and partial hand which
they had used towards worthies of Revolutionary
times. But he piously looked for the sustaining
support of Providence, and the kindness of a people
who had never yet deserted a public servant
honestly laboring in their cause. There was the
usual congratulation upon American institutions
and history. We were, he said,&mdash;and the boast
though not so delightful to the taste of a later time
was perfectly true,&mdash;without a parallel throughout
the world "in all the attributes of a great, happy,
and flourishing people." Though we restrained
government to the "sole legitimate end of political
institutions," we reached the Benthamite "greatest
happiness of the greatest number," and presented
"an aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere
to be found." We must, by observing the
limitations of government, perpetuate a condition
of things so singularly happy. Popular government,
whose failure had fifty years ago been boldly
predicted, had now been found "wanting in no
element of endurance or strength." His policy
should be "a strict adherence to the letter and
spirit of the constitution ... viewing it as limited
to national objects, regarding it as leaving to the
people and the States all power not explicitly parted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
with." Upon one question he spoke precisely. For
the first time slavery loomed up in the inaugural
of an American president. It seemed, however,
at once to disappear from politics in the practically
unanimous condemnation of the abolition agitation,
an agitation which, though carried on for the noblest
purposes, seemed&mdash;for such is the march of
human rights&mdash;insane and iniquitous to most patriotic
and intelligent citizens. Van Buren quoted
the explicit declaration made by him before the
election against the abolition of slavery in the District
of Columbia without the consent of the slave
States, and against "the slightest interference with
it in the States where it exists." Not a word was
said of the extension of slavery in the Territories.
That question still slept under the potion of the
Missouri Compromise, to wake with the acquisition
of Texas. In Van Buren's declaration there was
nothing in the slightest degree inconsistent even
with the Republican platforms of 1856 and 1860.</p>

<p>The inaugural concluded with a fine tribute to
Jackson. "I know," Van Buren said, "that I
cannot expect to perform the arduous task with
equal ability and success. But united as I have
been in his counsels, a daily witness of his exclusive
and unsurpassed devotion to his country's
welfare, agreeing with him in sentiments which his
countrymen have warmly supported, and permitted
to partake largely of his confidence, I may hope
that somewhat of the same cheering approbation
will be found to attend upon my path. For him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
I but express, with my own, the wishes of all, that
he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening
of his well-spent life."</p>

<p>The lucid optimism of the speech was in perfect
temper with this one of those shining and mellow
days, which even March now and then brings to
Washington. But there was latent in the atmosphere
a storm, carrying with it a furious and
complete devastation. In the month before the
inauguration, Benton, upon whom Van Buren was
pressing a seat in the cabinet, told the President-elect
that they were on the eve of an explosion of
the paper-money system. But the latter offended
Benton by saying: "Your friends think you a little
exalted in the head on the subject." And doubtless
the prophecies of the Bank opponents had been
somewhat discredited by the delay of the disaster
which was to justify their denunciations. The profoundly
thrilling and hidden delight which comes
with the first taste of supreme power, even to the
experienced and battered man of affairs, had been
enjoyed by Van Buren only a few days, when the
air grew heavy about him, and then perturbed, and
then violently agitated, until in two months broke
fiercely and beyond all restraint the most terrific
of commercial convulsions in the United States.
Since Washington began the experiment of our
federal government amid the sullen doubts of extreme
Federalists and extreme Democrats, no president,
save only Abraham Lincoln, has had to face
at the outset of his presidency so appalling a political
situation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>The causes of the panic of 1837 lay far deeper
than in the complex processes of banking or in the
faults of federal administration of the finances.
But, as a man suddenly ill prefers to find for his
ailment some recent and obvious cause, and is not
convinced by even a long and dangerous sickness
that its origin lay in old and continued habits of
life, so the greater part of the American people
and of their leaders believed this extraordinary
crisis to be the result of financial blunders of
Jackson's administration. They believed that Van
Buren could with a few strokes of his pen repair, if
he pleased, those blunders, and restore commercial
confidence and prosperity. The panic of 1837 became,
and has very largely remained, the subject of
political and partisan differences, which obscure its
real phenomena and causes. The far-seeing and
patriotic intrepidity with which Van Buren met its
almost overwhelming difficulties is really the crown
of his political career. Fairly to appreciate the
service he then rendered his country, the causes of
this famous crisis must be attentively considered.</p>

<p>In 1819 the United States suffered from commercial
and financial derangement, which may be
assumed to have been the effect of the second war
with Great Britain. The enormous waste of a
great war carried on by a highly organized nation
is apt not to become obvious in general business
distress until some time after the war has ended.
A buoyant extravagance in living and in commercial
and manufacturing ventures will continue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
after a peace has brought its extraordinary promises,
upon the faith of which, and in joyful ignorance,
the evil and inevitable day is postponed.
All this was seen later and on a vaster scale from
1865 to 1873. In 1821 the country had quite
recovered from its depression; and from this time
on to near the end of Jackson's administration the
United States saw a material prosperity, doubtless
greater than any before known. The exuberant
outburst of John Quincy Adams's message of 1827,&mdash;that
the productions of our soil, the exchanges
of our commerce, the vivifying labors of human
industry, had combined "to mingle in our cup a
portion of enjoyment as large and liberal as the
indulgence of Heaven has perhaps ever granted to
the imperfect state of man upon earth,"&mdash;was in
the usual tone of the public utterances of our presidents
from 1821 to 1837. Our harvests were
always great. We were a chosen people delighting
in reminders from our rulers of our prosperity, and
not restless under their pious urgency of perennial
gratitude to Providence. In 1821 the national
debt had slightly increased, reaching upwards of
$90,000,000; but from that time its steady and
rapid payment went on until it was all discharged in
1834. Our cities grew. Our population stretched
eagerly out into the rich Mississippi valley. From
a population of ten millions in 1821, we reached
sixteen millions in 1837. New York from about
1,400,000 became 2,200,000; and Pennsylvania
from about 1,000,000 became 1,600,000. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
amazing growth was at the West&mdash;Illinois from
60,000 to 400,000, Indiana from 170,000 to 600,000,
Ohio from 600,000 to 1,400,000, Tennessee
from 450,000 to 800,000. Missouri had increased
her 70,000 five-fold; Mississippi her 80,000 four-fold;
Michigan her 10,000 twenty-fold. Iowa and
Wisconsin were entirely unsettled in 1821; in
1837 the fertile lands of the former maintained
nearly forty thousand and of the latter nearly
thirty thousand hardy citizens. New towns and
cities rose with magical rapidity. With much that
was unlovely there was also exhibited an amazing
energy and capacity for increase in wealth. The
mountain barriers once passed, not only by adventurous
pioneers but by the pressing throngs of settlers,
there were few obstacles to the rapid creation
of comfort and wealth. Nor in the Mississippi
valley and the lands of the Northwest were the
settlers met by the harsh soil, the hostilities and
reluctance of nature in whose conquest upon the
Atlantic seaboard the American people had gained
some of their strongest and most enduring characteristics.
We hardly realize indeed how much better
it was for after times that our first settlements
were difficult. In the easy opening and tillage of
the rich and sometimes rank lands at the West
there was an inferior, a less arduous discipline.
American temper there rushed often to speculation,
rather than to toil or venture. It did not seem
necessary to create wealth by labor; the treasures
lay ready for those first reaching the doors of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
treasure house. To make easy the routes to El
Dorado of prairies and river bottoms was the
quickest way to wealth.</p>

<p>Roads, canals, river improvements, preceded, attended,
followed these sudden settlements, this vast
and jubilant movement of population. There was
an extraordinary growth of "internal improvements."
In his message of 1831, Jackson rejoiced
at the high wages earned by laborers in the construction
of these works, which he truly said were
"extending with unprecedented rapidity." The
constitutional power of the federal government to
promote the improvements within the States became
a serious question, because the improvements
proposed were upon so vast a scale. No single interest
had for fifteen years before 1837 held so
large a part of American attention as did the
making of canals and roads. The debates of Congress
and legislatures, the messages of presidents
and governors, were full of it. If the Erie Canal,
finished in 1825, had rendered vast natural resources
available, and had made its chief builder
famous, why should not like schemes prosper further
west? The success of railroads was already
established; and there was indefinite promise in
the extensions of them already planned. In 1830
twenty-three miles had been constructed; in 1831
ninety-four miles; and in 1836 the total construction
had risen to 1273 miles.</p>

<p>The Americans were then a far more homogeneous
people than they are to-day. The great Irish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
German, and Scandinavian immigrations had not
taken place. Our race diversities were, with exceptions,
unimportant in extent or lost in the lapse
of time, the diversities merely of British descendants.
Nor were there the extremes of fortune or
the diversities of occupation which have come with
the growth of cities and manufacturing interests.
The United States were still a nation of farmers.
The compensations and balances, which in the varying
habits and prejudices of a more varied population
tend to restrain and neutralize vagaries, did
not exist. One sentiment seized the whole nation
far more readily than could happen in the complexity
of our modern population and the diversity and
rivalry of its strains. Not only did this homogeneity
make Americans open to single impulses; but
there was little essential difference of environment.
They all, since the later days of Monroe's presidency,
had lived in the atmosphere of official delight
and congratulation over the past, and of unrestrained
promise for the future. All, whether in
the grain fields at the North or the cotton fields at
the South, had behind them the Atlantic with traditions
or experiences of poverty and oppression
beyond it. Every American had, in his own latitude,
since the ampler opening of roads and waterways,
and the peaceful conquest of the Appalachian
mountain ranges, seen to the west of him fertility
and promise and performance. And the fertility and
promise had, since the second English war, been no
longer in a land of hardship and adventure remote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and almost foreign to the seaboard. Every American
under Jackson's administration had before
him, as the one universal experience of those who
had taken lands at the West, an enormous and certain
increase of value, full of enchantment to those
lately tilling the flinty soil of New England or the
overused fields of the South. If new lands at the
West could be made accessible by internal improvements,
the succession of seed time and harvest
had for a dozen years seemed no more certain
than that the value of those lands would at once
increase prodigiously. So the American people
with one consent gave themselves to an amazing
extravagance of land speculation. The Eden which
Martin Chuzzlewit saw in later malarial decay was
to be found in the new country on almost every
stream to the east of the Mississippi and on many
streams west of it, where flatboats could be floated.
Frauds there doubtless were; but they were incidental
to the honest delusion of intelligent men
inspired by the most extraordinary growth the
world had seen. The often quoted illustration of
Mobile, the valuation of whose real estate rose
from $1,294,810 in 1831 to $27,482,961 in 1837,
to sink again in 1846 to $8,638,250, not unfairly
tells the story. In Pensacola, lots which to-day
are worth $50 each were sold for as much as lots
on Fifth Avenue in New York, which to-day are
worth $100,000 apiece. Real estate in the latter
city was assessed in 1836 at more than it was in
the greatly larger and richer city of fifteen years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
later. From 1830 to 1837 the steamboat tonnage
on the Western rivers rose from 63,053 to 253,661.
From 1833 to 1837 the cotton crop of the newer
slave States, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Arkansas and Florida, increased from
536,450 to 916,960 bales, while the price with
fluctuations rose from ten to twenty cents a pound.
Foreign capital naturally enough came to share in
the splendid money-making. From 1821 to 1833
the annual import of specie from England had
averaged about $100,000, in the last year being
only $31,903; but in 1834 it became $5,716,253,
in 1835 $914,958, and in 1836 $2,322,920, the entire
export to England of specie for all these three
years being but $51,807, while the average export
from 1822 to 1830 had been about $400,000; and
its amount in 1831 had been $2,089,766, and in
1832 $1,730,571. From 1830 to 1837, both years
inclusive, although the imports from all countries of
general merchandise exceeded the exports by $140,700,000,
there was no counter movement of specie.
The imports of specie from all countries during
these years exceeded the exports by the comparatively
enormous sum of $44,700,000. The foreigners
therefore took pay for their goods, not only in
our raw materials, but also in our investments or
rather our speculations, and sent these vast quantities
of moneys besides. So our good fortune
fired the imaginations of even the dull Europeans.
They helped to feed and clothe us that we might
experiment with Aladdin's lamp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>The price of public lands was fixed by law at
$1.25 an acre; and they were open to any purchaser,
without the wholesome limits of acreage
and the restraint to actual settlers which were
afterwards established. Here then was a commodity
whose price to wholesale purchasers did not rise,
and the very commodity by which so many fortunes
had been made. In public lands, therefore, the
fury of money-getting, the boastful confidence in
the future of the country, reached their climax.
From 1820 to 1829 the annual sales had averaged
less than $1,300,000, in 1829 being $1,517,175.
But in 1830 they exceeded $2,300,000, in 1831
$3,200,000, in 1832 $2,600,000, in 1833 $3,900,000,
and in 1834 $4,800,000. In 1835 they suddenly
mounted to $14,757,600, and in 1836 to
$24,877,179. In his messages of 1829 and 1830
Jackson not unreasonably treated the moderate increase
in the sales as a proof of increasing prosperity.
In 1831 his congratulations were hushed;
but in 1835 he again fancied, even in the abnormal
sales of that year, only an ampler proof of ampler
prosperity. In 1836 he at last saw that tremendous
speculation was the true significance of the enormous
increase. Prices of course went up. Everybody
thought himself richer and his labor worth
more. A week after Van Buren's inauguration a
meeting was held in the City Hall Park in New
York to protest against high rents and the high
prices of provisions; and with much discernment
the cry went up, "No rag money; give us gold
and silver!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no longer dispute that the prostration
of business in 1837, and for several years
afterward, was the perfectly natural result of the
speculation which had gone before. The absurd
denunciations of Van Buren by the most eminent
of the Whigs for not ending the crisis by governmental
interference are no longer respected. But
it is still fancied that the speculation itself was
caused by one financial blunder, and the crisis immediately
occasioned by another financial blunder,
of Jackson. It is not improbable that the deposits
of treasury moneys in fifty state banks<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> instead of
in the United States Bank and its twenty and
more branches, which began in the fall of 1833,
aided the tendency to speculation. But this aid
was at the most a slight matter. The impression
has been sedulously created that these state
banks, the "pet banks," were doubtful institutions.
There seems little reason to doubt that in general
they were perfectly sound and reputable institu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>tions,
with which the government moneys would
be quite as safe as with the United States Bank.
It is clear that if the latter Bank were not to be
rechartered, the deposits should, without regard
to the accusations of political meddling brought
against it, have been removed some time in advance
of its death in March, 1836. At best it is matter
of doubtful speculation whether the United States
Bank under Biddle's direction would, in 1834,
1835, and 1836, while the government deposits
were enormously increasing, have behaved with
much greater prudence and foresight than did the
state deposit banks. So far as actual experience
helps us, the doubt might well be solved in the
negative. The United States Bank, when its federal
charter lapsed, obtained a charter from Pennsylvania,
continuing under the same management;
and is said, and possibly with truth, to have entered
upon its new career with a great surplus. But it
proved no stronger than the state banks in 1837;
it obstructed resumption in 1838; it suspended
again in 1839, while the Eastern banks stood firm;
and in 1841 it went to pieces in disgraceful and
complete disaster.</p>

<p>The enormous extension of bank credits during
the three years before the break-down in 1837
was rather the symptom than the cause of the
disease. The fever of speculation was in the veins
of the community before "kiting" began. Bank
officers dwelt in the same atmosphere as did other
Americans, and their sanguine extravagance in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
turn stimulated the universal temper of speculation.</p>

<p>When the United States Bank lost the government
deposits, late in 1833, they amounted to a
little less than $10,000,000. On January 1, 1835,
more than a year after the state banks took the
deposits, they had increased to a little more than
$10,000,000. But the public debt being then paid
and the outgo of money thus checked, the deposits
had by January 1, 1836, reached $25,000,000, and
by June 1, 1836, $41,500,000. This enormous advance
represented the sudden increase in the sales
of public lands, which were paid for in bank paper,
which in turn formed the bulk of the government
deposits. The deposits were with only a small part
of the six hundred and more state banks then in
existence. But the increase in the sales of public
lands was the result of all the organic causes and
of all the long train of events which had seated
the fever of speculation so profoundly in the American
character of the day. To those causes and
events must ultimately be ascribed the extension
of bank credits so far as it immediately arose out
of the increase of government deposits. Nor is
there any sufficient reason to suppose that if the
deposits, instead of being in fifty state banks,
had remained in the United States Bank and its
branches, the tendency to speculation would have
been less. The influences which surrounded that
Bank were the very influences most completely
subject to the popular mania.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>But the increase of government deposits was only
fuel added to the flames. The craze for banks
and credits was unbounded before the removal of
the deposits had taken place, and before their great
increase could have had serious effect. Between
1830 and January 1, 1834, the banking capital of
the United States had risen from $61,000,000 to
about $200,000,000; the loans and discounts of
the banks from $200,000,000 to $324,000,000; and
their note circulation from $61,000,000 to $95,000,000.
The increase from January 1, 1834, to
January 1, 1836, was even more rapid, the banking
capital advancing in the two years to $251,000,000,
the loans and discounts to $457,000,000, and the
note circulation to $140,000,000. But there was
certainty of disaster in the abnormal growth from
1830 to 1834. The insanity of speculation was in
ample though unobserved control of the country
while Nicholas Biddle still controlled the deposits,
and was certain to reach a climax whether they
stayed with him or went elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is difficult rightly to apportion among the
statesmen and politicians of the time so much of
blame for the mania of speculation as must go to
that body of men. They had all drunk in the
national intoxication over American success and
growth. But if we pass from the greater and
deeper causes to the lesser though more obvious
ones, it is impossible not to visit the greater measure
of blame upon the statesmen who resisted
reduction of taxation, which would have left money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
in the pockets of those who earned it, and not
collected it in one great bank with many branches
or in fifty lesser banks; upon the statesmen who
insisted that the government ought to aid commercial
ventures by encouraging the loans to traders
of its own moneys held in the deposit banks; upon
the statesmen who promoted the dangerous scheme
of distributing the surplus among the States instead
of abolishing the surplus. As the condemnation
of public men in the wrong must be proportioned
somewhat to the distinction of their positions and
the greatness of their natural gifts, this larger
share of blame must go chiefly to Daniel Webster
and Henry Clay. At the head of their associates,
they had resisted the reduction of taxation. In
his speech on the tariff bill of 1832 Clay said,
with the exuberance so delightful to minds of
easy discipline, that our resources should "not be
hoarded and hugged with a miser's embrace, but
liberally used." They insisted upon freely lending
the public moneys. In his speech on the distribution
of the surplus, Webster urged that the
number of the deposit banks "be so far increased
that each may regard that portion of the public
treasure which it may receive as an increase of its
effective deposits, to be used, like other moneys in
deposit, as a basis of discount, to a just and proper
extent." The public money was locked up, he
declared, instead of aiding the general business of
the country. Nor after this was he ashamed in
1838 to condemn Jackson's secretary of the trea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>sury
for advising the new deposit banks, as he
had himself thus advised them, "to afford increased
facilities to commerce." If, indeed, Congress
would not take steps to keep a government
surplus out of the banks and in the pockets of
producers, the secretary ought not to have been
harshly judged for advising that the money go out
into commerce rather than lie in bank vaults.</p>

<p>The distribution of the surplus among the States
by the law of 1836 was the last and in some respects
the worst of the measures which aided and
exaggerated the tendency to speculation. By this
bill, all the money above $5,000,000 in the treasury
on January 1, 1837, was to be "deposited"
with the States in four quarterly installments commencing
on that day. According to the law the
"deposit" was but a loan to the States; but, as
Clay declared, not "a single member of either
House imagined that a dollar would ever be recalled."
It was in truth a mere gift. Clay's
triumphant ridicule of the opposition to this measure
has already been mentioned. Webster in
sounding periods declared his "deep and earnest
conviction" of the propriety of the stupendous
folly. He did not, indeed, defend the general
system of making the federal government a tax-gatherer
for the States. But this one distribution
would, he said in his speech of May 31, 1836,
"remove that severe and almost unparalleled pressure
for money which is now distressing and breaking
down the industry, the enterprise, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
the courage of the commercial community." The
Whig press declared that a congressman who could
for mere party reasons vote against a measure
which would bring so much money into his State,
must be "far gone in political hardihood as well
as depravity;" and that "to the Republican-Whig
party alone are the States indebted for the benefits
arising from the distribution." William H.
Seward, two years before and two years later the
Whig candidate for governor of New York, said
the proposal was "noble and just." The measure
passed the Senate with six Democratic votes
against it, among them the vote of Silas Wright,
then probably closer than any other senator to
Van Buren. Jackson yielded to the bill what in
his message in December of the same year he
called "a reluctant approval." He then gave at
length very clear reasons for his reluctance, but
none for his approval. He declared that "improvident
expenditure of money is the parent of
profligacy," and that no intelligent and virtuous
community would consent to raise a surplus for
the mere purpose of dividing it. In his first message,
indeed, Jackson had called the distribution
among the States "the most safe, just, and federal
disposition" of the surplus. But his views upon
this, as upon other subjects, had changed during
the composition of the Democratic creed which
went on during the early years of his administration.
His second message rehearsed at length the
objections to the distribution, though affecting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
meet them. In his third message he recommended
the abolition of unnecessary taxation, not the distribution
of its proceeds; and in 1832 he made his
explicit declaration that duties should be "reduced
to the revenue standard." Benton says it
was understood that in 1836 some of Van Buren's
friends urged Jackson to approve the bill, lest a
veto of so popular a measure might bring a Democratic
defeat. There must have been some reason
unrelated to the merit of the measure. But whatever
the opinions of Van Buren's friends, he took
care before the election to make known unequivocally,
in the Sherrod Williams letter already
quoted, his dislike of this piece of demagogy.
From the passage of the deposit bill in June,
1836, until the crash in 1837, this superb donation
of thirty-seven millions was before the enraptured
and deluded vision of the country. Over nine
millions a quarter to be poured into "improvements"
or loaned to the needy,&mdash;what a delightful
prospect to citizens harassed by the restraints
of prudent, fruitful industry! The lesson is striking
and wholesome, and ought not to be forgotten,
that it was when the land was in the very midst of
these largesses that the universal bankruptcy set
in.</p>

<p>During 1835 and 1836 there were omens of the
coming storm. Some perceived the rabid character
of the speculative fever. William L. Marcy,
governor of New York, in his message of January,
1836, answering the dipsomaniac cry for more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
banks, declared that an unregulated spirit of
speculation had taken capital out of the State;
but that the amount so transferred bore no comparison
to the enormous speculations in stocks
and in real property within the State. Lands
near the cities and villages of the State had risen
several hundred per cent. in value, and were sold,
not to be occupied by the buyers, but to be sold
again at higher prices. The passion for speculation
prevailed to an extent before unknown, not
only among capitalists, but among merchants, who
abstracted capital from their business for land and
stock speculations and then resorted to the banks.
The warning was treated contemptuously; but
before the year was out the federal administration
also became anxious, and the increase in land
sales no longer signified to Jackson an increasing
prosperity. The master hand which drew the
economic disquisition in his message of 1836
pointed to these sales as the effects of the extension
of bank credit and of the over-issue of bank
paper. The banks, it was declared, had lent their
notes as "mere instruments to transfer to speculators
the most valuable public land, and pay the
government by a credit on the books of the
banks." Each speculation had furnished means
for another. No sooner had one purchaser paid
his debt in the notes than they were lent to another
for a like purpose. The banks had extended their
business and their issues so largely as to alarm
considerate men. The spirit of expansion and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
speculation had not been confined to deposit
banks, but had pervaded the whole multitude of
banks throughout the Union, and had given rise
to new institutions to aggravate the evil. So
Jackson proceeded with his sound defense of the
famous specie circular, long and even still denounced
as the <i>causa causans</i> of the crisis of
1837.</p>

<p>By this circular, issued on July 11, 1836, the
secretary of the treasury had required payment
for public lands to be made in specie, with an exception
until December 15, 1836, in favor of actual
settlers and actual residents of the State in which
the lands were sold. The enormous sales of land
in this year, and the large payments required for
them under the circular, at once made the banks
realize that there ought to be an actual physical
basis for their paper transactions. Gold was
called from the East to the banks at the West to
make the land payments. Into the happy exaltation
of unreal transactions was now plunged that
harsh demand for real value which sooner or
later must always come. The demand was passed
on from one to another, and its magnitude and
peremptoriness grew rapidly. The difference between
paper and gold became plainer and plainer.
Nature's vital and often hidden truth that value
depends upon labor could no longer be kept secret
by a few wise men. The suspicion soon arose that
there was not real and available value to meet
the demands of nominal value. The suspicion was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
soon bruited among the less as well as the more
wary. Every man rushed to his bank or his
debtor, crying, "Pay me in value, not in promises
to pay; there is, I at last see, a difference between
them." But the banks and debtors had no available
value, but only its paper semblances. Every
man found that what he wanted, his neighbors did
not have to give him, and what he had, his neighbors
did not want.</p>

<p>This is hardly an appropriate place to attempt
an analysis of the elements of a commercial crisis.
But it is not possible rightly to estimate Van
Buren's moral courage and keen-sighted wisdom in
meeting the terrible pressure of 1837 without appreciating
what it was which had really happened.
The din of the disputes over the refusal to re-charter
the bank, over the removal of the deposits,
over the refusal to pay the last installment of the
distribution among the States, and over the specie
circular, resounds even to our own time. To many
the crisis seemed merely a financial or even a great
banking episode. Many friends of the administration
loudly cried that the disaster arose from the
treachery of the banks in suspending. Many of its
enemies saw only the normal fruit of administrative
blunders, first in recklessness, and last in heartless
indifference. To most Americans, whatever their
differences, the explanation of this profound and
lasting disturbance seemed to lie in the machinery
of finance, rather than in the deeper facts of the
physical wealth and power of the trading classes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>Speculation is sometimes said to be universal;
and it was never nearer universality than from
1830 to 1837. But speculation affects after all but
a small part of the community,&mdash;the part engaged
in trade, venture, new settlement or new manufacture;
those classes of men the form of whose work
is not established by tradition, but is changing and
improving under the spur of ingenuity and invention,
and with whom imagination is most powerful
and fruitful. These men use the surplus resources
of the vastly greater number who go on through
periods of high prices and of low prices with their
steady toil and unvaried production. In our country
and in all industrial communities it is to the
former comparatively small class that chiefly and
characteristically belong "good times" and "bad
times," panics and crises and depressions. It is
this class which in newspapers and financial reviews
becomes "the country." It chiefly supports the
more influential of the clergy, the lawyers, the editors,
and others of the professional classes. It
deals with the new uses and the accumulations of
wealth; it almost monopolizes public attention; it
is chiefly and conspicuously identified with industrial
and commercial changes and progress. But if
great depressions were as nearly universal as the
rhetoric of economists and historians would literally
signify, our ancestors fifty years ago must have experienced
a devastation such as Alaric is said to
have brought to the fields of Lombardy. But this
was not so. The processes of general production<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
went on; the land was tilled; the farmer's work
of the year brought about the same amount of comfort;
the ordinary mechanic was not much worse
off. If some keen observer from another planet
had in 1835 and again later in 1837 looked into
the dining-rooms and kitchens and parlors of America,
had seen its citizens with their families going
to church of a Sunday morning, or watched the tea-parties
of their wives, or if he had looked over the
fields and into the shops, there would have seemed to
him but slight difference between the two years in
the occupations, the industry, or the comfort of the
people. But if he had stopped looking and begun
to listen, he would in 1837 at once have perceived
a tremendous change. The great masses of producing
men would have been mute, as they usually
are. But the capitalists, the traders, the manufacturers,
all whose skill, courage, imagination,
and adventure made them the leaders of progress,
and whose voices were the only loud, clear, intelligible
voices, until there arose the modern organizations
of laboring men,&mdash;all those who in 1835
were flushed and glorious with a royal money-getting,&mdash;he
would now have heard crying in frenzy
and desperation. It is not meant to disparage the
importance of this smaller but louder body of men,
or to underrate the disaster which they suffered.
In proportion to their numbers, they were vastly
the most important part of the community. If they
were prostrated, there must not only suffer the
body of clerks, operatives, and laborers immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
engaged in their enterprises, and who may for economical
purposes be ranked with them; but later
on, the masses of the community must to a real extent
feel the interruption of progress which has
overtaken that section of the community to which
are committed the characteristic operations of material
progress; and whether through the fault or
the misfortune of that section, the injury is alike
serious. A wise ruler, in touching the finances of
his country, will forget none of this. He will look
through all the agitation of bankers and traders
and manufacturers, the well-voiced leaders of the
richer classes of men, to the far vaster processes of
industry carried on by men who are silent, and
whose silent industry will go on whatever devices
of currency or banking may be adopted. This wisdom
Van Buren now showed in an exalted degree.</p>

<p>The disaster which in 1837 overtook so large
and so important a part of the community was, in
its ultimate nature, not difficult to comprehend.</p>

<p>There had not been one equal and universal increase
in nominal values. Such an increase would
not have produced the crisis. But while the great
mass of the national industry went on in channels
and with methods and rates substantially undisturbed,
there took place an enormous and speculative
advance of prices in the cities where were
carried on the operations of important traders and
the promoters of enterprises, and in the very new
country where these enterprises found their material.
When a new canal or road was built, or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
new line of river steamers launched and an unsettled
country made accessible, several things inevitably
happened in the temper produced by the
jubilant observation of the past. There was not
only drawn from the ordinary industry of the country
the wealth necessary to build the canal or road
or steamers; but the country thus rendered accessible
seemed suddenly to gain a value measured by
the best results of former settlements, however
exceptional, and by the most sanguine hopes for
the future. The owners of the prairies and woods
and river bottoms became suddenly rich, as a miner
in Idaho becomes rich when he strikes a true fissure
vein. The owners of the canal or road or
line of steamers found their real investment at
once multiplied in dollars by the value of the country
whose trade they were to enjoy; for, new as
that value was, it seemed assured. Like investments
were made in banks, and in every implement
of direct or indirect use in the conduct of industries
which seemed to belong as a necessity to the
new value of the land. The numerous sales of lands
and of stocks in roads or canals or banks at rapidly
advancing prices did not alter the nature, although
they vastly augmented the effect, of what was happening.
The so-called "business classes" throughout
the country, related as they quickly became,
under the great impetus of the national hopefulness
and vanity, to the new lands, to the new cities and
towns and farms, and to the means of reaching
them and of providing them with the necessities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
and comforts of civilization, found their wealth
rapidly and largely increasing. Then naturally
enough followed the spending of money in personal
luxury. This meant the withdrawal of labor
in the older part of the country from productive
work, for which the country was fitted, to work
which, whether suitable or not, was unproductive.
The unproductive labor was paid, as the employers
supposed, from the new value lately created at the
West. So capital, that is, accumulated labor, was
first spent in improvements in the new country,
and then, and probably in a far greater amount,
spent in more costly food, clothes, equipage, and
other luxuries in the older country. The successive
sales at advancing prices simply increased the
sense of new wealth, and augmented more and
more this destructive consumption of the products
of labor, or the destructive diversion of labor from
productive to unproductive activity at the East by
the well-to-do classes.</p>

<p>On the eve of the panic the new wealth, whose
seeming possession apparently justified this destructive
consumption or diversion to luxury of
physical value, was primarily represented by titles
to lands, stocks in land, canal, turnpike, railroad,
transportation, or banking companies, and the
notes issued by banks or traders or speculators.
The value of these stocks and notes depended upon
the fruitfulness of the lands or canals or roads or
steamboat lines. Prices of many commodities had,
indeed, been enhanced by speculation beyond all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
proper relation to other commodities, measured by
the ultimate standard of the quantity and quality
of labor. But important as was this element, it
was subordinate to the apparent creation of wealth
at the West.</p>

<p>Before the panic broke, it began to appear that
mere surveys of wild tracts into lots made neither
towns nor cities; that canals and roads and steamboats
did not hew down trees or drain morasses or
open the glebe. The basis of the operations of
capitalists and promoters and venturers in new
fields, if those operations were to have real success,
must lie in the masses of strong and skillful
arms of men of labor. The operations were fruitless
until there came a population well sinewed and
gladly ready for arduous toil. In 1836 and 1837
the operators found that there was no longer a
population to give enduring life to their new operations.
They had far outstripped all the immediate
or even the nearly promised movements of settlers.
Men, however hardy, preferred to work within an
easier reach of the physical and social advantages
of settlements already made, until they could see
the superior fruitfulness of labor further on. The
new cities and towns and farms and the means
of reaching them would be mere paper assets until
an army of settlers was ready to enter in and make
them sources of actual physical wealth. But the
army stopped far short of the new Edens and metropolises.
There was no creation among them of
the actual wealth, the return of physical labor, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
make good and real the popular semblances of
wealth, upon the faith of which in the older part
of the country had arisen new methods of business
and habits of living. The withdrawal of actual
wealth from the multifarious treasuries of capital
and industry, to meet the expense of the improvements
at the West and the increased luxury at
the East, had reached a point where the pressure
caused by the deficiency of physical wealth was
too great for the hopefulness or credulity of those
who had been surrendering that wealth upon the
promises of successful and opulent settlements at
the West. Nor was all this confined to ventures
in the new States. Almost every Eastern city had
a suburb where with slight differences all the phenomena
of speculation were as real and obvious as
in Illinois or Mississippi.</p>

<p>Jackson's specie circular toppled over the house
of cards, which at best could have stood but little
longer. In place of bank-notes, which symbolized
the expectations and hopes of the owners of new
towns and improvements, the United States after
July, 1836, required from all but actual settlers
gold and silver for lands. An insignificant part of
the sales had been lately made to settlers. They
were chiefly made to speculators. The public
lands, which sold invariably at $1.25 an acre, were
enormously magnified in nominal value the instant
the speculators owned them. Paper money was
freely issued upon these estimates of value, to be
again paid to the government for more lands at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
$1.25. But now gold and silver must be found;
and nothing but actual labor could find gold and
silver. A further stream of true wealth was summoned
from the East, already denuded, as it was,
of all the surplus it had ready to be invested upon
mere expectation. Enormous rates were now paid
for real money. But of the real money necessary to
make good the paper bubble promises of the speculators
not one-tenth part really existed. Banks
could neither make their debtors pay in gold and
silver, nor pay their own notes in gold and silver.
So they suspended.</p>

<p>The great and long concealed devastation of
physical wealth and of the accumulation of legitimate
labor, by premature improvements and costly
personal living, became now quickly apparent.
Fancied wealth sank out of sight. Paper symbols
of new cities and towns, canals and roads, were
not only without value, but they were now plainly
seen to be so. Rich men became poor men. The
prices of articles in which there had been speculation
sank in the reaction far below their true
value. The industrious and the prudent, who had
given their labor and their real wealth for paper
promises issued upon the credit of seemingly assured
fortunes, suffered at once with men whose
fortunes had never been anything better than the
delusions of their hope and imagination.</p>

<p>It is now plain enough that to recover from this
crisis was a work of physical reparation to which
must go time, industry, and frugality. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
folly in every effort to retain and use as valuable
assets the investments in companies and banks
whose usefulness, if it had ever begun, was now
ended. There was folly in every effort to conceal
from the world by words of hopefulness the fact
that the imagined values in new cities and garden
lands had disappeared in a rude disenchantment
as complete as that of Abou-Hassan in the Thousand
and One Nights, or that of Sly, the tinker,
left untold in the Taming of the Shrew. Their
sites were no more than wild lands, whose value
must wait the march of American progress, fast
enough indeed to the rest of the world, but slow as
the snail to the wild pacing of the speculators.
Every pretense of a politician, whether in or out
of the senate chamber, that the government could
by devices of financiering avoid this necessity of
long physical repair, was either folly or wickedness.
And of this folly or even wickedness there was no
lack in the anxious spring and summer of 1837.</p>

<p>There had already occurred in many quarters
that misery which is borne by the humbler producers
of wealth not for their own consumption,
but simply for exchange, whose earnings are not
increased to meet the inflation of prices upon which
traders and speculators are accumulating apparent
fortunes and spending them as if they were real.
On February 14, 1837, several thousand people
met in front of the City Hall in New York under
a call of men whom the "Commercial Advertiser"
described as "Jackson Jacobins." The call was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
headed: "Bread, meat, rent, fuel! Their prices
must come down!" It invited the presence of "all
friends of humanity determined to resist monopolists
and extortionists." A very respectable meeting
about high prices had been held two or three
weeks before at the Broadway Tabernacle. The
meeting in the City Hall Park, with a mixture of
wisdom and folly, urged the prohibition of bank-notes
under $100, and called for gold and silver;
and then denounced landlords and dealers in provisions.
The excitement of the meeting was followed
by a riot, in which a great flour warehouse
was gutted. The rioters were chiefly foreigners
and few in number; nor were the promoters of the
meeting involved in the riot. The military were
called out; and Eli Hart &amp; Co., the unfortunate
flour merchants, issued a card pointing out with
grim truth "that the destruction of the article cannot
have a tendency to reduce the price."</p>

<p>The distribution of the treasury surplus to the
States precipitated the crash. The first quarter's
payment of $9,367,000 was made on January 1,
1837. There was disturbance in taking this large
sum of money from the deposit banks. Loans had
to be called in, and the accommodation to business
men lessened for the time. There was speculative
disturbance in the receipt of the moneys by the
state depositories. There was apprehension for
the next payment on April 1, which was accomplished
with still greater disturbance, and after
the crisis had begun. The calls for gold and silver,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
begun under the specie circular, and the disturbances
caused by these distributions, were increased
by financial pressure in England, whose money
aids to America were but partly shown by the
shipments of gold and silver already mentioned.
The extravagance of living had been shown in foreign
importations for consumption in luxury, to
meet which there had gone varied promises to pay,
and securities whose true value depended upon the
true and not the apparent creation of wealth in
America. Before the middle of March the money
excitement at Manchester was great; and to the
United States alone, it was then declared, attention
was directed for larger remittances and for specie.
The merchants of Liverpool about the same time
sent a memorial to the chancellor of the exchequer
saying "that the distress of the mercantile interest
is intense beyond example, and that it is rapidly
extending to all ranks and conditions of the community,
so as to threaten irretrievable ruin in all
directions, involving the prudent with the imprudent."
The "London Times" on April 10, 1837,
said that great distress and pressure had been produced
in every branch of national industry, and
that the calamity had never been exceeded.</p>

<p>The cry was quickly re&euml;choed from America.
Commercial failures began in New York about
April 1. By April 8 nearly one hundred failures
had occurred in that city,&mdash;five of foreign and exchange
brokers, thirty of dry-goods jobbers, sixteen
of commission houses, twenty-eight of real-estate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
speculators, eight of stock brokers, and several
others. Three days later the failures had reached
one hundred and twenty-eight. Provisions, wages,
rents, everything, as the "New York Herald" on
that day announced, were coming down. Within a
few days more the failures were too numerous to be
specially noticed; and before the end of the month
the rest of the country was in a like condition.
The prostration in the newer cotton States was
peculiarly complete. Their staple was now down
to ten cents a pound; within a year it had been
worth twenty. All other staples fell enormously
in price.</p>

<p>Later in April the merchants of New York met.
Instead of condemning their own folly, they resolved,
in a silly fury, that the disaster was due to
government interference with the business and commercial
operations of the country by requiring land
to be paid for in specie instead of paper, to its
destruction of the Bank, and to its substitution
of a metallic for a credit currency. A committee
of fifty, including Thomas Denny, Henry Parish,
Elisha Riggs, and many others whose names
are still honored in New York, was appointed to
remonstrate with the president. "What constitutional
or legal justification," it was seriously demanded,
"can Martin Van Buren offer to the people
of the United States for having brought upon
them all their present difficulties?" The continuance
of the specie circular, they said, was more
high-handed tyranny than that which had cost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Charles I. his crown and his head. On May 3
the committee visited Washington and told the
President that their real estate had depreciated
forty millions, their stocks twenty millions, their
immense amounts of merchandise in warehouses
thirty per cent. They piteously said to him, "The
noble city which we represent lies prostrate in despair,
its credit blighted, its industry paralyzed, and
without a hope beaming through the darkness, unless"&mdash;and
here we might suppose they would
have added, "unless Americans at once stop spending
money which has not been earned, and repair
the ruin by years of sensible industry and strict
economy." But the conclusion of the merchants
was that the darkness must continue unless relief
came from Washington. It was unjust, they said,
to attribute the evils to excessive development of
mercantile enterprise; they flowed instead from
"that unwise system which aimed at the substitution
of a metallic for a paper currency." The
error of their rulers "had produced a wider desolation
than the pestilence which depopulated our
streets, or the conflagration which laid them in
ashes." In the opinion of these sapient gentlemen
of business, it was the requirement that the United
States, in selling Western lands to speculators,
should be paid in real and not in nominal money,
which had prostrated in despair the metropolis of
the country. They asked for a withdrawal of the
specie circular, for a suspension of government suits
against importers on bonds given for duties, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
an extra session of Congress to pass Clay's bill
for the distribution of the land revenue among
the States, and for the re-chartering of the Bank.
Never did men out of their heads with fright propose
more foolish attempts at relief than some of
these. But the folly, as will be seen, seized statesmen
of the widest experience as well as frenzied
merchants. The President's answer was dignified,
but "brief and explicit." To the insolent suggestion
that Jackson's financial measures had been
more destructive than fire or pestilence, he calmly
reminded them that he had made fully known,
before he was elected, his own approval of those
measures; that knowing this the people had deliberately
chosen him; and that he would still adhere
to those measures. The specie circular should be
neither repealed nor modified. Such indulgence
in enforcing custom-house bonds would be allowed
as the law permitted. The emergency did not, he
thought, justify an extra session. Nicholas Biddle
called on Van Buren; and many were disgusted
that in the presence of this arch enemy the president
remained "profoundly silent upon the great
and interesting topics of the day."</p>

<p>Van Buren's resolution to face the storm without
either the aid or the embarrassment of the
early presence of Congress he was soon compelled
to abandon. Within a few days of the return of
the merchants to New York, that city sent the President
an appalling reply. On May 10 its banks
suspended payment of their notes in coin. A few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
days before some banks in lesser cities of the
Southwest had stopped. On the day after the
New York suspension, the banks of Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Albany, Hartford, New Haven, and
Providence followed. On the 12th the banks of
Boston and Mobile, on the 13th those of New
Orleans, and on the 17th those of Charleston and
Cincinnati fell in the same crash. There was
now simply a general bankruptcy. Men would
no longer meet their promises to pay, because no
longer could new paper promises pay off old ones.
No longer would men surrender physical wealth
safely in their hands for the expectation of wealth
to be created by the future progress of the country.
But men with perfectly real physical wealth
in their storehouses, which they could not themselves
use, were also in practical bankruptcy because
of their commercial debts most prudently
incurred. The natural exchange of their own
goods for goods which they or their creditors
might use was obstructed by the utter discredit of
paper money, and by the almost complete disappearance
of gold and silver. Extra sessions of
state legislatures were called to devise relief.
The banks' suspension of specie payment in New
York was within a few days legalized by the legislature
of that State. On May 12 the secretary of
the treasury directed government collectors themselves
to keep public moneys where the deposit
banks had suspended.</p>

<p>For banks holding the public moneys sank with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the others. And it was this which compelled Van
Buren in one matter to yield to the storm. On
May 15 he issued a proclamation for an extra session
of Congress to meet on the first Monday of
September. It would meet, the proclamation said,
to consider "great and weighty matters." No
scheme of relief was suggested. The locking up
of public moneys in suspended banks made necessary
some relief to the government itself. It was,
perhaps, well enough that excited and terrified
people, casting about for a remedy, should, until
their wits were somewhat restored, be soothed by
assurance that the great council of the nation
would, at any rate, discuss the situation. Moreover,
it was wise to secure time, that most potent
ally of the statesman. Within the three months
and a half to elapse, Van Buren, like a wise ruler,
thought the true nature of the calamity would become
more apparent; proposals of remedies might
be scrutinized; and thoughtless or superficial men
might weary of their own absurd proposals, or
the people might fully perceive their absurdity.</p>

<p>During the summer popular excitement ran
very high against the administration. The Whig
papers declared it to be "the melancholy truth,
the awful truth," that the administration did
nothing to relieve, but everything to distress the
commercial community. Abbot Lawrence, one of
the richest and most influential citizens of Boston,
told a great meeting, on May 17, that there was
no other people on the face of God's earth that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
were so abused, cheated, plundered, and trampled
on by their rulers; that the government exacted
impossibilities. No overt act, he said, with almost
a sinister suggestion, ought to be committed until
the laws of self-preservation compelled a forcible
resistance; but the time might come when the
crew must seize the ship. The friends of the administration
sought, indeed, to stem the tide; and
a series of skillfully devised popular gatherings
was held, very probably inspired by Van Buren,
who highly estimated such organized appeals to
popular sentiment. In Philadelphia a great meeting
denounced the bank suspensions and the issue
of small notes as devices in the interest of a foreign
conspiracy to throw silver coin out of circulation
and export it to Europe, to raise the prices of
necessaries, and recommence a course of gambling
under the name of speculation and trade, in which
the people must be the victims, and "the foreign
and home desperadoes" the gainers. The meeting
declared for a metallic currency. "We hereby
pledge our lives, if necessary," they said, "for the
support of the same." Later, on May 22, there
was in the same city a large gathering at Independence
Square, which solemnly called upon the
administration "manfully, fearlessly, and at all
hazards to go on collecting the public revenues
and paying the public dues in gold and silver."
Their forefathers, who fought for their liberties,
the framers of our Constitution, the patriarchs
whose memory they revered, were, with a funny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
mixture of truth and falsehood, declared to have
been hard-money men. A week later, a great
meeting in Baltimore approved the specie circular,
and urged its fearless execution, "notwithstanding
the senseless clamors of the British party;" for
the crisis, they said, was "a struggle of the virtuous
and industrious portions of the community
against bank advocates and the enemies to good
morals and republicanism." Protests were elsewhere
made against forcing small notes into circulation.
Paper had, however, to be used, for there
was nothing else. Barter must go on, even upon
the most flimsy tokens. In New York one saw,
as were seen twenty-four years later, bits of paper
like this: "The bearer will be entitled to fifty
cents' value in refreshments at the Auction Hotel,
123 and 125 Water Street. New York, May,
1837. Charles Redabock." In Tallahassee a
committee of citizens was appointed to print bank
tickets for purposes of change. In Easton the
currency had a more specific basis. One of the
tokens read: "This ticket will hold good for a
sheep's tongue, two crackers, and a glass of red-eye."</p>

<p>When Congress assembled, the country had cried
itself, if not to sleep, at least to seeming quiet.
The sun had not ceased to rise and set. Although
merchants and bankers were prostrate with anxiety
or even in irremediable ruin; although thousands
of clerks and laborers were out of employment or
earning absurdly low wages,&mdash;for near New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
hundreds of laborers were rejected who applied for
work at four dollars a month and board; although
honest frontiersmen found themselves hopelessly
isolated in a wilderness,&mdash;for the frontier had
suddenly shrunk far behind them,&mdash;still the harvest
had been good, the masses of men had been
at work, and economy had prevailed. The desperation
was over. But there was a profound melancholy,
from which a recovery was to come only too
soon to be lasting.</p>

<p>Van Buren's bearing in the crisis was admirable.
Even those who have treated him with animosity
or contempt do not here refuse him high
praise. "In this one question," says Von Holst,
"he really evinced courage, firmness, and statesmanlike
insight.... Van Buren bore the storm
bravely. He repelled all reproaches with decision,
but with no bitterness.... Van Buren unquestionably
merited well of the country, because he refused
his co&ouml;peration, in accordance with the guardianship
principle of the old absolutisms, to accustom
the people of the Republic also to see the
government enter as a saving <i>deus ex machina</i> in
every calamity brought about by their own fault
and folly.... Van Buren had won a brilliant
victory and placed his countrymen under lasting
obligations to him."<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Buren met the extra session with a message
which marks the zenith of his political wisdom. It
is one of the greatest of American state papers.
With clear, unflinching, and unanswerable logic he
faced the crisis. There was no effort to evade the
questions put to him, or to divert public attention
from the true issue. The government could not,
he showed, help people earn their living; but it
could refuse to aid the deception that paper was
gold, and the delusion that value could arise without
labor. The masterly argument seems long to a
sauntering reader; but it treated a difficult question
which had to be answered by the multitudes
of a democracy many of whom were pinched and
excited by personal distresses and anxiety and who
were sure to read it. Few episodes in our political
history give one more exalted appreciation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>good sense of the American masses, than that, in
this stress of national suffering, a skillful politician
should have appealed to them, not even sweetening
the truth, but resisting with direct and painful sobriety
their angry and natural impulses; this, too,
when most of the talented and popular leaders were
promoting, rather than reducing or diverting the
heated folly of the time.</p>

<p>Van Buren quietly began by saying that the law
required the secretary of the treasury to deposit
public moneys only in banks that paid their notes
in specie. All the banks had stopped such payment.
It was obvious therefore that some other
custody of public moneys must be provided, and it
was for this that he had summoned Congress. He
then began what was really an address to the people.
He pointed out that the government had not
caused, and that it could not cure, the profound
commercial distemper. Antecedent causes had
been stimulated by the enormous inflations of bank
currency and other credits, and among them the
many millions of foreign loans, and the lavish accommodations
extended "by foreign dealers to our
merchants." Thence had come the spirit of reckless
speculation, and from that a foreign debt of more
than thirty millions; the extension to traders in
the interior of credits for supplies greatly beyond
the wants of the people; the investment of thirty-nine
and a half millions in unproductive public
lands; the creation of debts to an almost countless
amount for real estate in existing or anticipated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
cities and villages; the expenditure of immense
sums in improvements ruinously improvident; the
diversion to other pursuits of labor that should
have gone to agriculture, so that this first of agricultural
countries had imported two millions of
dollars worth of grain in the first six months of
1837; and the rapid growth of luxurious habits
founded too often on merely fancied wealth. These
evils had been aggravated by the great loss of
capital in the famous fire at New York in December,
1835, a loss whose effects, though real, were
not at once apparent because of the shifting and
postponement of the burdens through facilities of
credit, by the disturbance which the transfers of
public moneys in the distribution among the States
caused, and by necessities of foreign creditors which
made them seek to withdraw specie from the United
States. He pointed out the unprecedented expansion
of credit in Great Britain at the same time,
and, with the redundancy of paper currency<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> there,
the rise of adventurous and unwholesome speculation.</p>

<p>To the demand for a re&euml;stablishment of a national
bank, he replied that quite a contrary thing
must be done; that the fiscal concerns of the government
must be separated from those of individuals
or corporations; that to create such a bank
would be to disregard the popular will twice
solemnly and unequivocally expressed; that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>same motives would operate on the administrators
of a national as on those of state banks; that the
Bank of the United States had not prevented former
and similar embarrassments, and that the
Bank of England had but lately failed in its own
land to prevent serious abuses of credit. He knew
indeed of loud and serious complaint because the
government did not now aid commercial exchange.
But this was no part of its duty. It was not the
province of government to aid individuals in the
transfer of their funds otherwise than through
the facilities of the post-office. As justly might
the government be asked to transport merchandise.
These were operations of trade to be conducted by
those who were interested in them. Throughout
Europe domestic as well as foreign exchanges were
carried on by private houses, and often, if not
generally, without the assistance of banks. Our
own exchanges ought to be carried on by private
enterprise and competition, without legislative assistance,
free from the influence of political agitation,
and from the neglect, partiality, injustice, and
oppression unavoidably attending the interference
of government with the proper concerns of individuals.
His own views, Van Buren declared, were
unchanged. Before his election he had distinctly
apprised the people that he would not aid in the
re&euml;stablishment of a national bank. His conviction
had been strengthened that such a bank meant
a concentrated money power hostile to the spirit
and permanency of our republican institutions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>He then turned to those state banks which had
held government deposits. At all times they had
held some of the federal moneys, and since 1833
they had held the whole. Since that year the
utmost security had been required from them for
such moneys; but when lately called upon to pay
the surplus to the States, they had, while curtailing
their discounts and increasing the general distress,
been with the other banks fatally involved in the
revulsion. Under these circumstances it was a
solemn duty to inquire whether the evils inherent
in any connection between the government and
banks of issue were not such as to require a divorce.
Ought the moneys taken from the people
for public uses longer to be deposited in banks
and thence to be loaned for the profit of private
persons? Ought not the collection, safe-keeping,
transfer, and disbursement of public moneys to
be managed by public officers? The public revenues
must be limited to public expenses so that
there should be no great surplus. The care of the
moneys inevitably accumulated from time to time
would involve expense; but this was a trifling consideration
in so important a matter. Personally it
would be agreeable to him to be free from concern
in the custody and disbursement of the public revenue.
Not indeed that he would shrink from a
proper official responsibility, but because he firmly
believed the capacity of the executive for usefulness
was in no degree promoted by the possession
of patronage not actually necessary. But he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
clear that the connection of the executive with
powerful moneyed institutions, capable of ministering
to the interests of men in points where they
were most accessible to corruption, was more liable
to abuse than his constitutional agency in the appointment
and control of the few public officers
required by the proposed plan.</p>

<p>Thus was announced the independent treasury
scheme, the divorce of bank and state, the famous
achievement of Van Buren's presidency. He
argued besides elaborately in favor of the specie
circular. An individual could, if he pleased, accept
payment in a paper promise or in any other
way as he saw fit. But a public servant should in
exchange for public domain take only what was
universally deemed valuable. He ought not to
have a discretion to measure the value of mere
promises. The $9,367,200 in the treasury for deposit
with the States in October, or rather for a
permanent distribution to them, he desired to retain
for federal necessities. This would doubtless
inconvenience States which had relied on the federal
donation; but as the United States needed
the money to meet its own obligations, there was
neither justice nor expediency in generously giving
it away. Van Buren here left the defensive with
a menace to the banks that a bankruptcy law for
corporations suspending specie payment might
impose a salutary check on the issues of paper
money.</p>

<p>The President finally spoke in words which seem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
golden to all who share his view of the ends of government.
"Those who look to the action of this
government," he said, "for specific aid to the citizen
to relieve embarrassments arising from losses
by revulsions in commerce and credit, lose sight of
the ends for which it was created, and the powers
with which it is clothed. It was established to
give security to us all, in our lawful and honorable
pursuits, under the lasting safeguard of republican
institutions. It was not intended to confer special
favors on individuals, or on any classes of them;
to create systems of agriculture, manufactures, or
trade; or to engage in them, either separately or
in connection with individual citizens or organizations....
All communities are apt to look to
government for too much.... We are prone to do
so especially at periods of sudden embarrassment
and distress.... The less government interferes
with private pursuits, the better for the general
prosperity. It is not its legitimate object to make
men rich, or to repair by direct grants of money
or legislation in favor of particular pursuits, losses
not incurred in the public service." To avoid unnecessary
interference with such pursuits would be
far more beneficial than efforts to assist limited
interests, efforts eagerly, but perhaps naturally,
sought for under temporary pressure. Congress
and himself, Van Buren closed by saying, acted
for a people to whom the truth, however unpromising,
could always be spoken with safety, and
who, in the phrase of which he was fond, were sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
never to desert a public functionary honestly laboring
for the public good.</p>

<p>An angry and almost terrible outburst received
this plain, honest, and wise declaration that the
people must repair their own disasters without paternal
help of government; and that, rather than to
promote the extension of credit with public moneys,
the crisis ought to afford means of departing forever
from that policy. Most of the able men who
to this generation have seemed the larger statesmen
of the day, joined with passionate declamation
in the furious gust of folly. It was a favorite
delusion that government was a separate entity
which could help the people, and not a mere agency,
simply using wealth and power which the people
must themselves create. Webster, in a speech at
Madison, Indiana, on June 1, 1837, professed his
conscientious convictions that all the disasters had
proceeded from "the measures of the general government
in relation to the currency." He ridiculed
the idea that the people had helped cause them.
The people, he thought, had no lesson to learn.
"Over-trading, over-buying, over-selling, over-speculation,
over-production,"&mdash;these, he said, were
terms he "could not very well understand." In
his speech of December, 1836, on the specie circular,
he had given a leonine laugh at the idea of
there being inflation. If he were asked, he said,
what kept up the value of money "in this vast and
sudden expansion and increase of it," he should
answer that it was kept up "by an equally vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
and sudden increase in the property of the country."
That this amazing utterance upon the dynamics
of national economy might be clear, he added
that the vast and sudden increase was "in the
value of that property intrinsic as well as marketable."
No speculator of the day said a more foolish
thing than did this towering statesman. There
were, he admitted, "other minor causes," but they
were "not worth enumerating." "The great and
immediate origin of the evil" was "disturbances
in the exchange ... caused by the agency of the
government itself." At the extra session Webster
described the shock caused him by the President's
"disregard for the public distress," by his "exclusive
concern for the interest of government and
revenue, by his refusal to prescribe for the sickness
and disease of society," by the separation he would
draw "between the interests of the government
and the interests of the people." For his part he
would be warm and generous in his statesmanship.
He resisted the bill to suspend the "deposit" with
the States; he would in the coming October pay
out the last installment, stricken though the treasury
was. He would again sweeten the popular
palate with government manna, bitter as it had
proved itself to the belly. It was the duty of the
government, he said, to aid in exchanges by establishing
a paper currency; he and those with him
preferred the long-tried, well-approved practice of
the government to letting Benton, as he said, "embrace
us in his gold and silver arms and hug us to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
his hard money breast." As if this were not a
time for soberness over its shameful abuses, credit,
and the banks and bank-notes which aided it were
almost apotheosized. At St. Louis in the summer,
Webster, in a speech which he did not include
in his collected works, said that help must come
"from the government of the United States, from
thence alone;" adding, "Upon this I risk my political
reputation, my honor, my all.... He who
expects to live to see all these twenty-six States
resuming specie payments in regular succession
once more, may expect to see the restoration of
the Jews. Never! He will die without the sight."</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams had told his friends at
home that the distribution of the public moneys
among the state banks was the most pernicious
cause of the disaster, although, differing from
Webster, he admitted that "the abuse of credit,
especially by the agency of banks," and the unrestrained
pursuit of individual wealth, were the
proximate causes of the disaster, for history had
testified</p>

<p class="poem">
"Peace to corrupt, no less than war to waste."<br />
</p>

<p>He would punish suspension of specie payments
by a bank with a forfeiture of its charter and
the imprisonment of its president and officers.
A national bank, he said, was "the only practicable
expedient for restoring and maintaining
specie payments." In the extra session he showed
that the deposit banks of the South already held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
more money of the government than their States
would receive, if the last installment of distribution
should be paid, while the Northern banks held far
less of that money than the Northern States were to
receive. He denounced as a Southern measure the
proposition to postpone this piece of recklessness.
Should the Northern States hail with shouts of
Hosanna "this evanescence of their funds from
their treasuries," or be "humbugged out of their
vested rights by a howl of frenzy against Nicholas
Biddle," or be mystified out of their money and
out of their senses by a Hark follow! against all
banks, or by a summons to Doctors' Commons for
a divorce of bank and state?</p>

<p>That skillful political weathercock, Caleb Cushing,
told his constituents at Lowell that private
banking was the "shinplaster system;" and asked
whether we wished to have men who, like the
Rothschilds, make "peace or war as they choose,
and wield at will the destiny of empires." The
plan of the administration was like that of "a
cowardly master of a sinking ship, to take possession
of the long boat and provisions, cut off, and
leave the ship's company and passengers to their
fate." To the plausible cry of separating bank
and state he would answer, "Why not separate
court and state ... or law and state ... or custom-house
and state." It was "the new nostrum
of political quackery." Clay delivered a famous
speech in the Senate on September 25, 1837. He
was appalled at the heartlessness of the administra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>tion.
"The people, the States, and their banks,"
he said in the favorite cant of the time, "are left
to shift for themselves," as if that were not the
very thing for them to do. We were all, he said,&mdash;"people,
States, Union, banks, ... all entitled
to the protecting care of a parental government."
He cried out against "a selfish solicitude for the
government itself, but a cold and heartless insensibility
to the sufferings of a bleeding people." The
substitution of an exclusive metallic currency was
"forbidden by the principles of eternal justice."
For his part he saw no adequate remedy which did
"not comprehend a national bank as an essential
part of it." In banking corporations, indeed,
"the interests of the rich and poor are happily
blended;" nor should we encourage here private
bankers, Hopes and Barings and Rothschilds and
Hottinguers, "whose vast overgrown capitals, possessed
by the rich exclusively of the poor, control
the destiny of nations."</p>

<p>The bill for the independent treasury was firmly
pressed by the administration. It did not deceive
the people with any pretense that banks and paper
money would stand in lieu of industry, economy,
and good sense. The summer elections, then far
more numerous than now, had, as Clay warningly
pointed out, gone heavily against Van Buren. The
bill passed the Senate, 26 to 20. In the House it
was defeated. Upon the election of speaker, the
administration candidate, James K. Polk, had had
116 votes to 103 for John Bell. But this very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
moderate majority was insecure. A break in the
administration ranks was promptly shown by the
defeat, for printers to the House, of Francis P.
Blair and his partner, who in their paper, the
"Washington Globe," had firmly supported the
hard money and anti-bank policy. They received
only 107 votes, about fifteen Democrats uniting
with the Whigs to defeat them. Van Buren was
unable to educate all his party to his own firm,
clear-sighted views. There was formed a small
party of "conservatives," Democrats who took
what seemed, and what for the time was, the popular
course. The independent treasury bill was
defeated in the House by 120 to 106.</p>

<p>Van Buren's proposal was carried, however, to
postpone the "deposite," as it was called, the gift
as it was, of the fourth installment of the surplus.
On October 1, Webster and Clay led the seventeen
senators who insisted upon the folly of the
national treasury in its destitution playing the
magnificent donor, and further debauching the
States with streams of pretended wealth. Twenty-eight
senators voted for the bill; and in the House
it was carried by 118 to 105, John Quincy Adams
heading the negative vote.</p>

<p>The administration further proposed the issue
of $10,000,000 in treasury notes. It was a measure
strictly of temporary relief. Gold and silver
had disappeared; bank-notes were discredited.
The government, whose gold and silver the banks
would not pay out, was disabled from meeting its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
current obligations; and the treasury notes were
proposed to meet the necessity. They were not to
be legal tender, but interest-bearing obligations in
denominations not less than $50, to be merely receivable
for all public dues, and thus to gain a
credit which would secure their circulation. This
natural and moderate measure was assailed by
those who were lauding a paper currency to the
skies. The radical difference was ignored between
a general currency of small as well as large bills,
without intrinsic value, adopted for all time, and
a limited and perfectly secure government loan, to
be freely taken or rejected by the people, in bills
of large amounts, to meet a serious but brief embarrassment.
"Who expected," said Webster in
the Senate, "that in the fifth year of the experiment
for reforming the currency, and bringing
it to an absolute gold and silver circulation, the
Treasury Department would be found recommending
to us a regular emission of paper money?"
He voted, however, for the bill, the only negative
votes in the Senate being given by Clay and four
others. In the House it was carried by 127 to 98.</p>

<p>Such was the substantial work of the extra session.
To the experience of that crisis and the
wisdom with which it was met may not improbably
be ascribed the hard-money leaven which,
thirty or forty years later, prevented the great
disaster of further paper inflation, and brought
the country to a currency which, if not the best, is
a currency of coin and of redeemable paper, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
value, apart from the legal-tender notes left us by
the war and the decision of the Supreme Court,
depends upon the best of securities, coin or government
bonds, deposited in the treasury, and a
currency whose amount may therefore safely be
left to the natural operations of trade.</p>

<p>Clay's appeal for a great banking institution,
which should accomplish by magic the results of
popular labor and saving, was met by a vote of
the House, 123 to 91, that it was inexpedient to
charter a national bank, many voting against a
bank who had already voted against an independent
treasury. The Senate also resolved against
a national bank by 31 to 14, six senators who had
voted against an independent treasury voting also
against a bank. The temporary expedient adopted
by the treasury on the suspension of the banks was
therefore continued, and public moneys were kept
in the hands of public officers.</p>

<p>Calhoun now rejoined the Democratic party.
It was only the year before he had denounced it
as "a powerful faction held together by the hopes
of public plunder;" and early in this very year
he had referred to the removal of the deposits as
an act fit for "the days of Pompey or C&aelig;sar," and
had declared that even a Roman Senate would not
have passed the expunging resolution "until the
times of Caligula and Nero." But Van Buren,
Calhoun now said, had been driven to his position;
nor would he leave the position for that reason.
He referred to the strict construction of the powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
of the government involved in the divorce of bank
and state. There was no suggestion that Van
Buren had become a convert to nullification. But
Calhoun could with consistency support Van
Buren. The independent treasury scheme was
plainly far different from the removal of the deposits
from one great bank to many lesser ones.
The reasons for political exasperation had besides
disappeared. Van Buren was chief among the
<i>beati possidentes</i>, and could not for years be disturbed.
His tact and skill left open no personal
feud; he had not yet conferred the title of C&aelig;sar;
no successor to himself was yet named by any
clear designation. Calhoun joined Silas Wright
and the other administration senators; but he still
maintained a grim and independent front.</p>

<p>The extra session ended on October 16. Besides
the issuance of $10,000,000 in treasury notes
and the postponement of the distribution among
the States, the only measure adopted for relief
was a law permitting indulgence of payment to
importers upon custom-house bonds. As those
payments were to be made in specie, and as specie
had left circulation, it was proper that the United
States as a creditor should exhibit the same leniency
which was wise and necessary on the part of
other creditors.</p>

<p>Commercial distress had now materially abated,
although many of its wounds were still deep and
unhealed. Before the regular session began in
December, substantial progress was made towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
specie payments. The price of gold in New York,
which had ruled at a premium of eight and seven
eighths per cent., had fallen to five. On October
20 the banks of New York, after waiting until
Congress rose, to meet the wishes of the United
States Bank and its associates in Philadelphia,
now invited representatives from all the banks to
meet in New York on November 27 to prepare for
specie payment. At this meeting the New York
banks proposed resumption on March 1, 1838, but
they were defeated; and a resolution to resume on
July 1 was defeated by the votes of Pennsylvania
and all the New England States except Maine
(which was divided), together with New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland, South Carolina, and Indiana.
Virginia, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky,
and the District of Columbia, with New
York, made the minority. An adjournment was
taken to the second Wednesday in April, the
banks being urged meanwhile to prepare for
specie payments.</p>

<p>The fall as well as the summer elections had
been most disastrous for the Democrats. New
York, which the year before had given Van Buren
nearly 30,000 plurality, was now overwhelmingly
Whig. The Van Buren party began to be called
the Loco-focos, in derision of the fancied extravagance
of their financial doctrines. The Loco-foco
or Equal Rights party proper was originally a division
of the Democrats, strongly anti-monopolist
in their opinions, and especially hostile to banks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>&mdash;not
only government banks but all banks,&mdash;which
enjoyed the privileges then long confirmed by special
and exclusive charters. In the fall of 1835
some of the Democratic candidates in New York
were especially obnoxious to the anti-monopolists of
the party. When the meeting to regularly confirm
the nominations made in committee was called at
Tammany Hall, the anti-monopolist Democrats
sought to capture the meeting by a rush up the
main stairs. The regulars, however, showed themselves
worthy of their regularity by reaching the
room up the back stairs. In a general scrimmage
the gas was put out. The anti-monopolists, perhaps
used to the devices to prevent meetings which
might be hostile, were ready with candles and loco-foco
matches. The hall was quickly illuminated;
and the anti-monopolists claimed that they had defeated
the nominations. The regulars were successful,
however, at the election; and they and the
Whigs dubbed the anti-monopolists the Loco-foco
men. The latter in 1836 organized the Equal
Rights party, and declared it an imperative duty
of the people "to recur to first principles." Their
"declaration of rights" might well have been
drawn a few years later by a student of Spencer's
"Social Statics." The law, they said, ought to do
no more than restrain each man from committing
aggressions on the equal rights of other men; they
declared "unqualified hostility to bank-notes and
paper money as a circulating medium," and to all
special grants by the legislature. A great cry was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
raised against them as dangerous and incendiary
fanatics. The Democratic press, except the "Evening
Post," edited by William Cullen Bryant, turned
violently upon the seceders. There was the same
horror of them as the English at almost the very
time had of the Chartists, and which in our time
is roused by the political movements of Henry
George. But with time and familiarity Chartism
and Loco-focoism alike lost their horrid aspect.
Several of the cardinal propositions of the former
have been adopted in acts of Parliament without a
shudder. To the animosity of the Loco-focos
against special legislation and special privileges
Americans probably owe to-day some part of the
beneficent movement in many of the States for constitutional
requirements that legislatures shall act
by general laws.</p>

<p>The Equal Rights party, though casting but a
few votes, managed to give the city of New York
to the Whigs, a result which convinced the Democrats
that, dangerous as they were, they were less
dangerous within than without the party. The
hatred which Van Buren after his message of September,
1837, received from the banks commended
him to the Loco-focos; and in October, 1837,
Tammany Hall witnessed their reconciliation with
the regular Democrats upon the moderate declaration
for equal rights. The Whigs had, indeed,
been glad enough to have Loco-foco aid and even
open alliance at the polls. But none the less
they thought the Democratic welcome back of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
seceders an enormity. From this time the Democrats
were, it was clear, no better than Loco-focos,
and ought to bear the name of those dangerous
iconoclasts.</p>

<p>Van Buren met Congress in December, 1837,
with still undaunted front. His first general review
of the operations of the government was but
little longer than his message to the extra session
on the single topic of finance. He refused to consider
the result of the elections as a popular disapproval
of the divorce of bank and state. In only
one State, he pointed out, had a federal election
been held; and in the other elections, which had
been local, he intimated that the fear of a forfeiture
of the state-bank charters for their suspension
of specie payments had determined the result. He
still emphatically opposed the connection between
the government and the banks which could offer
such strong inducements for political agitation.
He blew another blast against the United States
Bank, now a Pennsylvania corporation, for continuing
to reissue its notes originally made before
its federal charter had expired and since returned.
He recommended a pre&euml;mption law for the benefit
of actual settlers on public lands, and a classification
of lands under different rates, to encourage
the settlement of the poorer lands near the older
settlements. There was a conciliatory but firm
reference to the dispute with England over the
northeastern boundary. He announced his failure
to adjust the dispute with Mexico over the claims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
which had been pressed by Jackson. The Texan
cloud which six years later brought Van Buren's
defeat was already threatening.</p>

<p>At this session the independent or sub-treasury
bill was again introduced, and again a titanic battle
was waged in the Senate. In this encounter Clay
taunted Calhoun for going over to the enemy; and
Calhoun, referring to the Adams-Clay coalition,
retorted that Clay had on a memorable occasion
gone over, and had not left it to time to disclose
his motives. Here it was that, in the decorous
fury of the times, both senators stamped accusations
with scorn in the dust, and hurled back darts
fallen harmless at their feet. The bill passed the
Senate by 27 to 25; but Calhoun finally voted
against it because there had been stricken out the
provision that government dues should be paid in
specie. The bill was again defeated in the House
by 125 to 111. The latter vote was late in June,
1838. But while Congress refused a law for it,
the independent treasury in fact existed. Under
the circular issued upon the bank suspension, the
collection, keeping, and payment of federal moneys
continued to be done by federal officers. The absurdity
of the declamation about one's blood curdling
at Van Buren's recommendations, about this
being the system in vogue where people were
ground "to the very dust by the awful despotism
of their rulers," was becoming apparent in the
easy, natural operation of the system, dictated
though it was by necessity rather than law. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
Whigs, in the sounding jeremiades of Webster and
the perfervid eloquence of Clay, were joined by the
Conservatives, former Democrats, with Tallmadge
of New York and Rives of Virginia at their head.
They had retired into the cave of superior wisdom,
of which many men are fond when a popular storm
seems rising against their party; they affected oppressive
grief at Van Buren's reckless hatred of
the popular welfare, and accused him of designing
entire destruction of credit in the ordinary transactions
of business. This silly charge was continually
made, and gained color from the extreme
doctrines of the Equal Rights movement and the
fixing of the Loco-foco name upon the Democratic
party.</p>

<p>The sub-treasury bill was again taken up at the
long session of 1839-40 by the Congress elected in
1838. Again the wisdom of separating bank and
state, again the wrong of using public moneys to
aid private business and speculation, were stated
with perfectly clear but uninspiring logic. Again
came the antiphonal cry, warm and positive, against
the cruelty of withdrawing the government from an
affectionate care for the people, and from its duty
generously to help every one to earn his living. In
and out of Congress it was the debate of the time,
and rightly; for it involved a profound and critical
issue, which since the foundation of the government
has been second in importance only to the
questions of slavery and national existence and reconstruction.
In 1840 the bill passed the Senate by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
24 to 18 and the House by 124 to 107. This chief
monument of Van Buren's administration seemed
quickly demolished by the triumphant Whigs in
1841, but was finally set up again in 1846 without
the aid of its architect. From that time to our
own, in war and in peace, the independence of the
federal treasury has been a cardinal feature of
American finance. Nor was its theory lost even
in the system of national banks and public depositories
created for the tremendous necessities of the
civil war.<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>By the spring of 1838 business had revived
during the year of enforced industry and economy
among the people. In January, 1838, the premium
on gold at New York sank to three per cent.; and
when the bank convention met on the adjourned
day in April, the premium was less than one per
cent. The United States Bank resisted resumption
with great affectation of public spirit, but for selfish
reasons soon to be disclosed. The New York
banks, with an apology to their associates, resolved
to resume by May 10, five days before the date to
which the State had legalized the suspension. The
convention adopted a resolution for general resumption
on January 1, 1839, without precluding
earlier resumption by any banks which deemed it
proper. In April it was learned that the Bank of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>England was shipping a million sterling to aid resumption
by the banks. On July 10, Governor
Ritner of Pennsylvania by proclamation required
the banks of his State to resume by August 1.
On the 13th of that month the banks of Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois yielded to the moral coercion of
the New York banks, and to the resumption now
enforced on the Bank of the United States. By
the fall of 1838 resumption was general, although
the banks at the Southwest did not follow until
midwinter. Confidence was so much restored that
"runs" on the banks did not occur. The crisis
seemed at an end; and Van Buren not unreasonably
fancied that he saw before the country two
years of steady and sound return to prosperity.
Two such years would, in November, 1840, bring
the reward of his sagacity and endurance. But a
far deeper draft upon the vitality of the patient
had been made than was supposed; and in its
last agony, eighteen months later, Biddle's bank
helped to blast Van Buren's political ambition.</p>

<span class="ft80">PRESIDENT.&mdash;CANADIAN INSURRECTION.&mdash;TEXAS.&mdash;SEMINOLE
WAR.&mdash;DEFEAT FOR RE&Euml;LECTION</span></h2>


<p>Another unpopular duty fell to Van Buren
during his presidency, a duty but for which New
York might have been saved to him in 1840. In
the Lower and Upper Canadas popular discontent
and political tumult resulted late in 1837 in violence,
so often the only means by which English
dependencies have brought their imperial mistress
to a respect for their complaints.<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The liberality
of the Whigs, then lately triumphant in England,
was not broad enough to include these distant
colonists. The provincial legislature in each of
the Canadas consisted of a Lower House or assembly
chosen by popular vote, and an Upper House
or council appointed by the governor, who himself
was appointed by and represented the crown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Reforms after reforms, proposed by the popular
houses, were rejected by the council. In Lower
Canada the popular opposition was among the
French, who had never been embittered towards
the United States. In Upper Canada its strength
was among settlers who had come since the war
closed in 1815. Lower Canada demanded in vain
that the council be made elective. Its assembly,
weary of the effectual opposition of the council to
popular measures, began in 1832 to refuse votes of
supplies unless their grievances were redressed;
and by 1837 government charges had accrued to
the amount of &pound;142,100. On April 14, 1837,
Lord John Russell, still wearing the laurel of a
victor for popular rights, procured from the imperial
parliament permission, without the assent of
the colonial parliament, to apply to these charges
the money in the hands of the receiver-general of
Lower Canada. This extraordinary grant passed
the House of Commons by 269 to 46. A far less
flagitious case of taxation without representation
had begun the American Revolution. The money
had been raised under laws which provided for its
expenditure by vote of a local representative body.
It was expended by the vote of a body at Westminster,
three thousand miles away, but few of
whose members knew or cared anything for the
bleak stretch of seventeenth-century France on the
lower St. Lawrence, and none of whom had contributed
a penny of it. To even Gladstone, lately
the under-secretary for the colonies and then a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
"rising hope of unbending Tories," there seemed
nothing involved but the embarrassment of faithful
servants of the crown. This thoroughly British
disregard of sentiment among other people
roused a deep opposition which was headed by
Papineau, eloquent and a hero among the French.
An insurrection broke out in November, 1837, and
blood was shed in engagements at St. Denis and
St. Charles, not far from Montreal. But the insurgents
were quickly defeated, and within three
weeks the insurrection in Lower Canada was
ended.</p>

<p>In Upper Canada there was considerable Republican
sentiment, and the party of popular rights
had among its leaders men of a high order of
ability. One of them, Marshall S. Bidwell,
through the magnanimity or procurement of the
governor, escaped from Canada to become one of
the most honored and stately figures at the bar of
New York. Early in 1836, Sir Francis B. Head,
a clever and not ill-natured man, arrived as governor.
He himself wrote the unconscious Anglicism
that "the great danger" he "had to avoid
was the slightest attempt to conciliate any party."
It was assumed with the usual insufferable affectation
of omniscience that these hardy Western settlers
were merely children who did not know what
was best for them. Even the suggestions of concession
sent him from England were not respected.
In an election for the Assembly he had the issue
announced as one of separation from England;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
and by the use, it was said, of his power and patronage,
the colonial Tories carried a majority of
the House. Hopeless of any redress, and fired by
the rumors of the revolt in Lower Canada, an
insurrection took place early in December near
Toronto. It was speedily suppressed. One of the
leaders, Mackenzie, escaped to Buffalo. Others
were captured and punished, some of them capitally.</p>

<p>The mass of the Canadians were doubtless opposed
to the insurrection. But there was among
them a widespread and reasonable discontent, with
which the Americans, and especially the people of
northern and western New York, warmly sympathized.
It was natural and traditional to believe
England an oppressor; and there was every reason
in this case to believe the Canadians right in their
ill-feeling. The refugees who had fled to New
York met with an enthusiastic reception, and, in
the security of a foreign land, prepared to advance
their rebellion. On the long frontier of river,
lake, and wilderness, it was difficult, with the meagre
force regularly at the disposal of the United
States, to prevent depredations. This difficulty
became enhanced by a culpable though not unnatural
invasion of American territory by British
troops. On December 12, 1837, Mackenzie, who
had the day before arrived with a price of $4000
set upon his head, addressed a large audience at
Buffalo. Volunteers were called for; and the next
day, with twenty-five men, commanded by Van<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
Rensselaer, an American, he seized Navy Island
in the Niagara River, but a short distance above
the cataract, and belonging to Canada. He there
established a provisional government, with a flag
and a great seal; and that the new State might be
complete, paper money was issued. By January,
1838, there were several hundred men on the
island, largely Americans, with arms and provisions
chiefly obtained from the American side.</p>

<p>On the night of December 29, 1837, a party of
Canadian militia crossed the Niagara to seize the
Caroline, a steamer in the service of the rebels.
It happened, however, that the steamer, instead of
being at Navy Island, was at Schlosser, on the
American shore. The Canadians seized the vessel,
killing several men in the affray, and after setting
her on fire, loosened her from the shore, to go blazing
down the river and over the falls. This invasion
of American territory caused indignant excitement
through the United States. Van Buren had
promptly sought to prevent hostility from our territory.
On January 5, 1838, he had issued a proclamation
reciting the seizure of Navy Island by a
force, partly Americans, under the command of an
American, with arms and supplies procured in the
United States, and declared that the neutrality
laws would be rigidly enforced and the offenders
punished. Nor would they receive aid or countenance
from the United States, into whatever difficulties
they might be thrown by their violation of
friendly territory. On the same day Van Buren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
sent General Winfield Scott to the frontier, and
by special message asked from Congress power to
prevent such offenses in advance, as well as afterwards
to punish them,&mdash;a request to which Congress,
in spite of the excitement over the invasion
at Schlosser, soon acceded. The militia of New
York were, on this invasion, called out by Governor
Marcy, and placed under General Scott's
command. But there was little danger. On January
13 the insurgents abandoned Navy Island.
The war, for the time, was over, although excitement
and disorder continued on the border and
the lakes as far as Detroit; and in the fall of 1838
other incursions were made from American territory.
But they were fruitless and short-lived.
Nearly nine hundred arrests were made by the
Canadian authorities. Many death sentences were
imposed and several executed, and many more
offenders were sentenced to transportation.</p>

<p>England, in her then usual fashion, was duly
waked to duty by actual bloodshed. Sir Francis
B. Head left Canada, and the Melbourne ministry
sent over the Earl of Durham, one of the finest
characters in English public life, to be governor-general
over the five colonies; to redress their
wrongs; to conciliate, and perhaps yield to demands
for self-government: all which might far better
have been done five years before. Lord Durham
used a wise mercy towards the rebels. He made
rapid progress in the reforms, and, best and first
of all, he won the confidence and affection of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
people. But England used to distrust an English
statesman who practiced this kind of rule towards
a dependency. A malevolent attack of Lord
Brougham was successful, and Lord Durham returned
to ministerial disgrace, though to a wiser
popular applause, soon to die in what ought to have
been but an early year in his generous and splendid
career. Although punishing her benefactor,
England was shrewd enough to accept the benefit.
The concessions which Lord Durham had begun
were continued, and Canada became and has remained
loyal. Before leaving Canada, Lord Durham
was invited by a very complimentary letter of
Van Buren to visit Washington, but the invitation
was courteously declined.</p>

<p>Mackenzie was arrested at Buffalo and indicted.
After his indictment he addressed many public
meetings through the United States in behalf of his
cause, one at Washington itself. In 1839, however,
he was tried and convicted. Van Buren,
justly refusing to pardon him until he had served
in prison two thirds of his sentence, thus made for
himself a persistent and vindictive enemy.</p>

<p>Upon renewed raids late in 1838, the President,
by a proclamation, called upon misguided or deluded
Americans to abandon projects dangerous to
their own country and fatal to those whom they
professed a desire to relieve; and, after various
appeals to good sense and patriotism, warned them
that, if taken in Canada, they would be left to the
policy and justice of the government whose domin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>ions
they had, "without the shadow of justification
or excuse, nefariously invaded." This had no uncertain
sound. Van Buren was promptly declared
to be a British tool. The plain facts were ignored
that the great majority of the Canadians, however
much displeased with their rulers, were hostile to
Republican institutions and to a separation from
England, and that the majority in Canada had the
same right to be governed in their own fashion as
the majority here. There was seen, however, in
this firm performance of international obligations,
only additional proof of Van Buren's coldness
towards popular rights, and of his sycophancy to
power.</p>

<p>The system of allowing to actual settlers, at the
minimum price, a pre&euml;mption of public lands already
occupied by them, was adopted at the long
session of 1837-38. Webster joined the Democrats
in favoring the bill, against the hot opposition
of Clay, who declared it "a grant of the property
of the whole people to a small part of the
people." The dominant party was now wisely committed
to the policy of using the public domain for
settlers, and not as mere property to be turned into
money. But a year or two before, the latter system
had in practice wasted the national estate and
corrupted the public with a debauchery of speculation.</p>

<p>The war between Mexico and the American settlers
in her revolted northeast province began in
1835. Early in 1836 the heroic defense of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
Alamo against several thousand Mexicans by less
than two hundred Americans, and among them
Davy Crockett, Van Buren's biographer, and the
butchery of all but three of the Americans, had
consecrated the old building, still proudly preserved
by the stirring but now peaceful and pleasing city
of San Antonio, and had roused in Texas a fierce
and resolute hatred of Mexico. In April, 1836,
Houston overwhelmed the Mexicans at San Jacinto,
and captured their president, Santa Anna.</p>

<p>In his message of December 21, 1836, Jackson,
although he announced these successes of the Texans
and their expulsion of Mexican civil authority, still
pointed out to Congress the disparity of physical
force on the side of Texas, and declared it prudent
that we should stand aloof until either Mexico
itself or one of the great powers should have recognized
Texan independence, or at least until the
ability of Texas should have been proved beyond
cavil. The Senate had then passed a resolution for
recognition of Texan independence. But the House
had not concurred; and before Van Buren's inauguration
Congress had done no more than authorize
the appointment of a diplomatic agent to Texas
whenever the President should be satisfied of its
independence. In August, 1837, the Texan representative
at Washington laid before Van Buren a
plan of annexation of the revolted Mexican state.
The offer was refused; and it was declared that the
United States desired to remain neutral, and perceived
that annexation would necessarily lead to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
war with Mexico. In December, 1837, petitions
were presented in Congress against the annexation of
Texas, now much agitated at the South; and Preston,
Calhoun's senatorial associate from South Carolina,
offered a resolution for annexation. Some
debate on the question was had in 1838, in which
both the pro-slavery character of the movement
and the anti-slavery character of the opposition
clearly appeared. But this danger to Van Buren
was delayed several years. Nor was he yet a character
in the drama of the slavery conflict which by
1837 was well opened. The agitation over abolition
petitions and the murder of Lovejoy the abolitionist
are now readily enough seen to have been
the most deeply significant occurrences in America
between Van Buren's inauguration and his defeat;
but they were as little part of his presidency as the
arrival at New York from Liverpool on April 22
and 23, 1838, of the Sirius and the Great Western,
the first transatlantic steamships. In Washington
the slavery question did not get beyond the halls
of Congress. The White House remained for several
years free from both the dangers and the
duties of the question accompanying the discussion.</p>

<p>Van Buren's administration pressed upon Mexico
claims arising out of wrongs to American citizens
and property which had long been a grievance.
Jackson had thought it our duty, in view of the
"embarrassed condition" of that republic, to "act
with both wisdom and moderation by giving to
Mexico one more opportunity to atone for the past."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
In December, 1837, Van Buren, tired of Mexican
procrastination, referred the matter to Congress,
with some menace in his tone. In 1840 a treaty
was at last made for an arbitration of the claims,
the king of Prussia being the umpire. John Quincy
Adams vehemently assailed the American assertion
of these claims, as intended to "breed a war with
Mexico," and "as machinery for the annexation
of Texas;" and his violent denunciations have obtained
some credit. But Adams himself had been
pretty vigorous in the maintenance of American
rights. And the plain and well known facts are,
that after several years of negotiation the claims
were with perfect moderation submitted for decision
to a disinterested tribunal; that they were never
made the occasion of war; and that Van Buren opposed
annexation.</p>

<p>In June, 1838, James K. Paulding, long the
navy agent at New York, was made secretary of
the navy in place of Mahlon Dickerson of New
Jersey, who now resigned. Paulding seems to us
rather a literary than a political figure. Besides
the authorship of part of "Salmagundi," of "The
Dutchman's Fireside," and of other and agreeable
writings grateful to Americans in the days when
the sting of the question, "Who reads an American
book?" lay rather in its truth than in its ill-nature,
Paulding's pen had aided the Republican
party as early as Madison's presidency. Our politics
have always, even at home, paid some honor to
the muses, without requiring them to descend very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
far into the partisan arena. A curious illustration
was the nomination of Edwin Forrest, the famous
tragedian, for Congress by the Democrats of New
York in 1838, a nomination which was more sensibly
declined than made. An almost equally curious
instance was the tender Van Buren made of the
secretaryship of the navy to Washington Irving before
he offered it to Paulding, who was a connection
by marriage of Irving's brother. Van Buren
had, it will be remembered, become intimately acquainted
with Irving abroad; and others than Van
Buren strangely enough had thought of him for
political service. The Jacksonians had wanted him
to run for Congress; and Tammany Hall had offered
him a nomination for mayor of New York.
Van Buren wrote to Irving that the latter had "in
an eminent degree those peculiar qualities which
should distinguish the head of the department," and
that this opinion of his had been confirmed by Irving's
friends, Paulding and Kemble, the former of
whom it was intimated was "particularly informed
in regard to the services to be rendered." But one
cannot doubt that in writing this the President had
in mind the sort of service to the public, and the
personal pleasure and rest to himself, to be brought
by a delightful and accomplished man of letters,
who was no mere recluse, but long practiced in polished
and brilliant life abroad, rather than any
business or executive or political ability. Irving
wisely replied that he should delight in full occupation,
and should take peculiar interest in the navy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
department; but that he shrank from the harsh
turmoils of life at Washington, and the bitter personal
hostility and the slanders of the press. A
short career at Washington would, he said, render
him "mentally and physically a perfect wreck."
Paulding's appointment to the cabinet portfolio
assigned to New York was not agreeable to the
politicians; and they afterwards declared that, if
Marcy had been chosen instead, the result in 1840
might have been different. The next Democratic
president gave the same place to another famous
man of letters, George Bancroft.</p>

<p>On June 6, 1837, Louis Napoleon wrote the
President from New York that the dangerous illness
of his mother recalled him to the old world;
and that he stated the reason for his departure lest
the President might "have given credence to the
calumnious surmises respecting" him. The famous
adventurer used one of those many phrases of his
which, if they had not for years imposed on the
world, no wise man would believe could ever have
obtained respect. Van Buren, as the ruler of a free
people, ought to be advised, the prince wrote, that,
bearing the name he did, it was impossible for him
"to depart for an instant from the path pointed
out to me by my conscience, my honor, and my
duty."</p>

<p>The elections of 1838 showed a recovery from
the defeat in 1837, a recovery which would perhaps
have been permanent if the financial crisis
had been really over. Maine wheeled back into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
the Van Buren ranks; and Maryland and Ohio
now joined her. In New Jersey and Massachusetts
the Whig majorities were reduced; and in
New York, where Seward and Weed had established
a political management quite equal to the
Regency, the former was chosen governor by a
majority of over 10,000, but still less by 5000
than the Whig majority of 1837. The Democrats
now reaped the unpopularity of Van Buren's upright
neutrality in the Canadian troubles. Northern
and western New York gave heavy Whig
majorities. Jefferson county on the very border,
which had stood by Van Buren even in 1837, went
over to the Whigs.</p>

<p>Van Buren met Congress in December, 1838,
with more cheerful words. The harvest had been
bountiful, he said, and industry again prospered.
The first half century of our Constitution was
about to expire, after proving the advantage of a
government "entirely dependent on the continual
exercise of the popular will." He returned firmly
to his lecture on economics and the currency, drawing
happily, but too soon, a lesson from the short
duration of the suspension of specie payments in
1837 and the length of that in 1814. We had
been saved, he said, the mortification of seeing our
distresses used to fasten again upon us so "dangerous
an institution" as a national bank. The treasury
would be able in the coming year to pay off the
$8,000,000 outstanding of the $10,000,000 of treasury
notes authorized at the extra session. Texas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
had withdrawn its application for admission to the
Union. The final removal of the Indian tribes to
the west of the Mississippi in accordance with the
Democratic policy was almost accomplished. There
were but two blemishes on the fair record the White
House sent to the Capitol. Swartwout, Jackson's
collector of New York, was found, after his super-session
by Jesse Hoyt, to be a defaulter on a vast
scale. His defalcations, the President carefully
pointed out, had gone on for seven years, as well
while public moneys were kept with the United
States Bank and while they were kept with state
banks, as while they were kept by public officers.
It was broadly intimated that this disgrace was
not unrelated to the general theory which had
so long connected the collection and custody of
public moneys with the advancement of private interests;
and the President asked for a law making
it a felony to apply public moneys to private uses.
Swartwout's appointment in 1829, as has been said,
was strenuously opposed by Van Buren as unfit to
be made. After a year or two Jackson returned
to Van Buren his written protest, saying that time
had proved his belief in Swartwout's unfitness to
be a mistake. Van Buren's own appointment to
the place was, however, far from an ideal one.
Jesse Hoyt was shown by his published correspondence&mdash;a
veritable instance, by the way, of "<i>stolen</i>
sweets"&mdash;to have been a shrewd, able man, who
enjoyed the strangely varied confidence of many
distinguished, discreet, and honorable men, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
many very different persons, ranging through a
singular gamut of religion, morals, statesmanship,
economics, politics, patronage, banking, trade, stock
gambling, and betting. The respectability of some
of Hoyt's friends and his possession of some ability
palliate, but do not excuse, his appointment to a
great post.</p>

<p>The second Florida war still dragged out its slow
and murderous length. The Seminoles under pressure
had yielded to Jackson's firm policy of removing
all the Indian tribes to the west of the Mississippi.
The policy seemed, or rather it was, often
cruel, as is so much of the progress of civilization.
But the removal was wise and necessary. Tribal
and independent governments by nomadic savages
could not be tolerated within regions devoted to the
arts and the government of white men. Whatever
the theoretical rights of property in land, no civilized
race near vast areas of lands fit for the tillage
of a crowding population has ever permitted them
to remain mere hunting grounds for savages.
The Seminoles in 1832, 1833, and 1834 agreed to
go west upon terms like those accepted by other
Indians. The removal was to take place, one third
of the tribe in each of the three years 1833, 1834,
and 1835; but the dark-skinned men, as their white
brothers would have done, found or invented excuses
for not keeping their promise of voluntary
expatriation. Late in 1835, when coercion, although
it had not yet been employed against the
Seminoles, was still feared by them, they rose under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
their famous leader, the half-breed Powell, better
known as Osceola, and massacred the federal agent
and Major Dade, and 107 out of 111 soldiers under
him. Then followed a series of butcheries and outrages
upon white men of which we have heard, and
doubtless of crimes enough upon Indians of which
we have not heard. Among the everglades, the
swamps and lakes of Florida, its scorching sands
and impenetrable thickets, a difficult, tedious, inglorious,
and costly contest went on. Military evolutions
and tactics were of little value; it was a
war of ambushes and assassination. Osceola,
coming with a flag of truce, was taken by General
Jessup, the defense for his capture being his violation
of a former parole. He was sent to Fort Moultrie,
in Charleston harbor, and there died, after furnishing
recitations to generations of schoolboys,
and sentiment to many of their elders. Van Buren
had been compelled to ask $1,600,000 from Congress
at the extra session. Before his administration
was ended nearly $14,000,000 had been spent;
and not until 1842 did the war end. It was one
of the burdens of the administration which served
to irritate a people already uneasy for deeper and
more general reasons. The prowess of the Indian
chief, his eloquence, his pathetic end, the miseries
and wrongs of the aborigines, the cost and delay
of the war, all re&euml;nforced the denunciation of Van
Buren by men who made no allowance for embarrassments
which could be surmounted by no ability,
because they were inevitable to the settlement by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
civilized race of lands used by savages. Time,
however, has vindicated the justice and mercy, as
well as the policy of the removal, and of the establishment
of the Indian Territory.</p>

<p>A few days before the close of the session Van
Buren asked Congress to consider the dispute with
Great Britain over the northeast boundary. Both
Maine and New Brunswick threatened, by rival
military occupations of the disputed territory, to
precipitate war. Van Buren permitted the civil
authorities of Maine to protect the forests from
destruction; but disapproved any military seizure,
and told the state authorities that he should propose
arbitration to Great Britain. If, however,
New Brunswick sought a military occupation, he
should defend the territory as part of the State.
Congress at once authorized the President to call
out 50,000 volunteers, and put at his disposal a
credit of $10,000,000. Van Buren persisted in
his great effort peacefully to adjust the claims of
our chronically belligerent northeastern patriots,&mdash;in
Maine as in New York finding his fate in his duty
firmly and calmly to restrain a local sentiment inspiring
voters of great political importance to him.
The "news from Maine" in 1840 told of the angry
contempt the hardy lumbermen felt for the President's
perfectly statesmanlike treatment of the
question.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1839 Van Buren visited his
old home at Kinderhook; and on his way there
and back enjoyed a burst of enthusiasm at York,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
Harrisburg, Lebanon, Reading, and Easton in
Pennsylvania, at Newark and Jersey City in New
Jersey, and at New York, Hudson, and Albany in
his own State. There were salutes of artillery,
pealing of bells, mounted escorts in blue and white
scarfs, assemblings of "youth and beauty," the
complimentary addresses, the thronging of citizens
"to grasp the hand of the man whom they had
delighted to honor," and all the rest that makes
up the ovations of Americans to their black-coated
rulers. He landed in New York at Castle Garden,
amid the salutes of the forts on Bedloe's,
Governor's, and Staten Islands, and of a "seventy-four,"
whose yards were covered with white uniformed
sailors. After the reception in Castle
Garden he mounted a spirited black horse and
reviewed six thousand troops assembled on the
Battery; and then went in procession along Broadway
to Chatham Street, thence to the Bowery, and
through Broome Street and Broadway back to the
City Hall Park. Not since Lafayette's visit had
there been so fine a reception. At Kinderhook he
was overwhelmed with the affectionate pride of his
old neighbors. He declined public dinners, and
by the simple manner of his travel offered disproof
of the stories about his "English servants, horses
and carriages." The journey was not, however,
like the good-natured and unpartisan presidential
journeys of our time. The Whigs often churlishly
refused to help in what they said was an electioneering
tour. Seward publicly refused the invita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>tion
of the common council of New York to participate
in the President's reception, because the
State had honored him with the office of governor
for his disapproval of Van Buren's political character
and public policy, and because an acceptance
of the invitation "would afford evidence of
inconsistency and insincerity." Van Buren's own
friends gave a party air to much of the welcome.
Democratic committees were conspicuous in the
ceremonies; and in many of the addresses much
that was said of his administration was fairly in a
dispute certain to last until the next year's election
was over. Van Buren could hardly have objected
to the coldness of the Whigs, for his own speeches,
though decorous and respectful to the last degree
to those who differed from him, were undisguised
appeals for popular support of his financial policy.
At New York he referred to the threatening dissatisfaction
in his own State concerning his firm
treatment of the Canadian troubles. But he was
persuaded, he said, that good sense and ultimately
just feeling would give short duration to these unfavorable
impressions.</p>

<p>The President was too experienced and cool in
judgment to exaggerate the significance of superficial
demonstrations like these, which often seemed
conclusive to his exuberant rival Clay. He was
encouraged, however, by the elections of 1839. In
Ohio the Whigs were "pretty essentially used up,"
though unfortunately not to remain so a twelve-month.
In Massachusetts Morton, the Van Buren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
candidate for governor, was elected by just one
vote more than a majority of the 102,066 votes
cast. Georgia, New Jersey, and Mississippi gave
administration majorities. In New York the adverse
majority which in 1837 had been over 15,000,
and in 1838 over 10,000, was now less than 4000,
in spite of the disaffection along the border counties.
It was not an unsatisfactory result, although
for the first time since 1818 the legislature was
completely lost. Another year, Van Buren now
hoped, would bring a complete recovery from the
blow of 1837. But the autumn of 1839 had also
brought a blast, to grow more and more chilling
and disastrous.</p>

<p>In the early fall the Bank of the United States
agreed to loan Pennsylvania $2,000,000; and for
the loan obtained the privilege of issuing $5 notes,
having before been restricted to notes of $20 and
upwards. "Thus has the Van Buren State of
Pennsylvania," it was boasted, "enabled the banks
to overcome the reckless system of a Van Buren
national administration." The price of cotton,
which had risen to 16 cents a pound, fell in the
summer of 1839, and in 1840 touched as low a
point as 5 cents. In the Northwest many banks
had not yet resumed since 1837. To avoid execution
sales it was said that two hundred plantations
had been abandoned and their slaves taken to
Texas. The sheriff, instead of the ancient return,
<i>nulla bona</i>, was said, in the grim sport of the
frontier, to indorse on the fruitless writs "G. T.,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
meaning "Gone to Texas." A money stringency
again appeared in England, in 1839. Its exportation
of goods and money to America had again
become enormous. The customs duties collected
in 1839 were over $23,000,000, and about the
same as they had been in 1836, having fallen in
1837 to $11,000,000, and afterwards in 1840 falling
to $13,000,000. Speculation revived, the land
sales exceeding $7,000,000 in 1839, while they had
been $3,700,000 in 1838, and afterwards fell to
$3,000,000 in 1840. Under the pressure from
England the Bank of the United States sank
with a crash. The "Philadelphia Gazette," complacently
ignoring the plain reasons for months
set before its eyes, said that the disaster had "its
chief cause in the revulsion of the opium trade
with the Chinese;" that upon the news that the
Orientals would no longer admit the drug the
Bank of England had "fairly reeled;" and that,
the balance of trade being against us, we had to
dishonor our paper. Explanations of like frivolity
got wide credence. The Philadelphia banks suspended
on October 9, 1839, the banks of Baltimore
the next day, and in a few days the banks in the
North and West followed. The banks of New
York and New England, except those of Providence,
continued firm. Although the excitement
of 1839 did not equal that of 1837, there was a
duller and completer despondency. It was at last
known that the recuperative power of even our
own proud and bounding country had limits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Years were yet necessary to a recovery. But the
presidential election would not, alas! wait years.
With no faltering, however, Van Buren met Congress
in December, 1839. He began his message
with a regret that he could not announce a year of
"unalloyed prosperity." There ought never, as
presidential messages had run, to be any alloy in
the prosperity of the American people. But the
harvest, he said, had been exuberant, and after all
(for the grapes of trade and manufacture were a
little sour), the steady devotion of the husbandman
was the surest source of national prosperity. A
part of the $10,000,000 of treasury notes was still
outstanding, and he hoped that they might be
paid. We must not resort to the ruinous practice
of supplying supposed necessities by new loans; a
permanent debt was an evil with no equivalent.
The expenditures for 1838, the first year over
whose appropriations Van Buren had had control,
had been less than those of 1837. In 1839 they
had been $6,000,000 less than in 1838; and for
1840 they would be $5,000,000 less than in 1839.
The collection and disbursement of public moneys
by public officers rather than by banks had, since
the bank suspensions in 1837, been carried on
with unexpected cheapness and ease; and legislation
was alone wanting to insure to the system the
highest security and facility. Nothing daunted by
the second disaster so lately clouding his political
future, Van Buren sounded another blast against
the banks. With unusual abundance of harvests,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
with manufactures richly rewarded, with our granaries
and storehouses filled with surplus for
export, with no foreign war, with nothing indeed
to endanger well-managed banks, this banking disaster
had come. The government ought not to
be dependent on banks as its depositories, for the
banks outside of New York and Philadelphia were
dependent upon the banks in those great cities,
and the latter banks in turn upon London, "the
centre of the credit system." With some truth,
but still with a touch of demagogy, venial perhaps
in the face of the blatant and silly outcries against
him from very intelligent and respectable people,
he said that the founding of a new bank in a distant
American village placed its business "within
the influence of the money power of England."
Let us then, he argued, have gold and silver and
not bank-notes, at least in our public transactions;
let us keep public moneys out of the banks. Again
he attacked the national bank scheme. In 1817
and 1818, in 1823, in 1831, and in 1834 the United
States Bank had swelled and maddened the tides
of banking, but had seldom allayed or safely directed
them. Turning with seemingly cool resolution,
but with hidden anxiety, to the menacing
distresses of the American voters, he did not
flinch or look for fair or flattering words. We
must not turn for relief, he said, to gigantic banks,
or splendid though profitless railroads and canals.
Relief was to be sought, not by the increase, but
by the diminution of debt. The faith of States<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
already pledged was to be punctiliously kept; but
we must be chary of further pledges. The bounties
of Providence had come to reduce the consequences
of past errors. "But let it be indelibly
engraved on our minds," he said, "that relief is
not to be found in expedients. Indebtedness cannot
be lessened by borrowing more money, or by
changing the form of the debt."</p>

<p>The House of Representatives was so divided
that its control depended upon whether five Whig
or five Democratic congressmen from New Jersey
should be admitted. They had been voted for
upon a general ticket through the whole State; and
the Whig governor and council had given the certificate
of election to the Whigs by acquiescing in
the actions of the two county clerks who had, for
irregularities, thrown out the Democratic districts
of South Amboy and Millville. A collision arose
curiously like the dispute over the electoral returns
from Florida and Louisiana in 1877. This exclusion
of the two districts the Democrats insisted to
have been wrongful; and not improbably with reason,
for at the next election in 1839 the State,
upon the popular vote, gave a substantial majority
against the Whigs, although by the district division
of the State a majority of the legislature were
Whigs and re&euml;lected the Whig governor. The
clerk of the national House had, according to usage,
prepared a roll of members, which he proceeded to
call. He seems to have placed on the roll the
names of the New Jersey representatives holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
the governor's certificates. But before calling their
names, he stated to the House that there were
rival credentials; that he felt that he had no power
to decide upon the contested rights; and that, if
the House approved, he would pass over the names
until the call of the other States was finished. The
rival credentials included a record of the votes
upon which the governor's certificate was presumed
to be based. Objection was made to passing New
Jersey, and one of the governor's certificates was
read. The New Jerseymen with certificates insisted
that their names should be called. The clerk
declined to take any step without the authority of
the House, holding that he was in no sense a chairman.
He behaved in the case with modesty and
decorum, and the savage criticisms upon him seem
to have no foundation except this refusal of his to
decide upon the <i>prima facie</i> right to the New
Jersey seats, or to act as chairman except upon
unanimous consent. He was clearly right. He
had no power. The very roll he prepared, and his
reading it, had no force except such as the House
chose to give them. Upon any other theory he
would practically wield an enormous power justified
neither by the Constitution nor by any law. On
the fourth day of tumult a simple and lawful
remedy was discovered to be at hand. Any member
could himself act as chairman to put his own motion
for the appointment of a temporary speaker;
and if a majority acquiesced, there was at once
an organization without the clerk's aid. This was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
in precise accord with the attitude of the clerk,
hotly abused as he was by Adams and others who
adopted his position. So Adams proposed himself
to put the question on his own motion to call the
roll with the members holding certificates. Further
confusion then ensued, which was terminated by
Rhett of South Carolina, who moved that John
Quincy Adams act as chairman until a speaker
should be chosen. Rhett put his own motion, and
it was carried. Adams took the chair, rules were
adopted, and order succeeded chaos. None of the
New Jerseymen were permitted to vote for speaker,
but a few Calhoun Democrats refused to vote for
the administration candidate. Most of the administration
members offered to accept a Calhoun man;
but a few of them, naturally angry at South Carolina
dictation, refused, under Benton's advice, to
vote for him. At last the Whigs joined the Calhoun
men, and ended this extraordinary contest.
The speaker, Robert M. T. Hunter, was a so-called
states-rights man, and a supporter of the independent
treasury scheme. He had the fortune, after a
singularly varied and even important career in the
United States and the Confederate States, to be
appointed by President Cleveland to the petty
place of collector of customs at Tappahannock, in
Virginia, and to live among Americans who were
familiar with his prominence fifty years ago, but
supposed him long since dead. The clerk, Hugh
A. Garland, was re&euml;lected, in spite of what Adams
in his diary, after his picturesque but utterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
unjustifiable fashion, called the "baseness of his
treachery to his trust." The Whig New Jerseymen
were refused seats, and the apparent perversion of
the popular vote was rightly defeated by seating
their rivals. The Whigs posed as defenders of
the sanctity of state authority, and sought, upon
that political issue, to force the Van Buren men to
be the apologists for centralization.</p>

<p>It was at this session that the sub-treasury bill
was passed. As a sort of new declaration of independence
Van Buren signed it on July 4, 1840.
His long and honorable and his greatest battle was
won. It was the triumph of a really great cause.
The people, by their labor and capital, were to
support the federal government as a mere agency
for limited purposes. That government was not,
in this way at least, to support or direct or control
either the people or their labor or capital. But
the captain fell at the time of his victory. The
financial disaster of 1839 had exhausted the good-nature
and patience of the people. Dissertations
on finance and economics, however wise, now served
to irritate and disgust. These cool admonitions to
economy and a minding of one's business were
popularly believed to be heartless and repulsive.</p>

<p>In 1840 took place the most extraordinary of presidential
campaigns. While Congress was wrangling
over the New Jersey episode in December,
1839, the Whig national convention again nominated
Harrison for President. Tyler was taken
from the ranks of seceding Democrats as the can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>didate
for Vice-President. The slaughter of Henry
Clay, the father of the Whig party, had been
effected by the now formidable Whig politicians
of New York, cunningly marshaled by Thurlow
Weed. Availability had its first complete triumph
in our national politics. They had not come, Governor
Barbour of Virginia, the president of the
Whig convention, said, to whine after the fleshpots
of Egypt, but to give perpetuity to Republican
institutions. To reach this end (not very explicitly
or intelligibly defined), it mattered not what letters
of the alphabet spelled the name of the candidate;
for his part, he could sing Hosanna to any alphabetical
combination. No platform or declaration
of principles was adopted, lest some of those discontented
with Van Buren should find there a
counter-irritant. The candidates, in accepting their
nominations, refrained from political discussion.
Harrison stood for the plain, honest citizen, coming,
as one of the New York conventions said,
"like another Cincinnatus from his plough," resolute
for a generous administration, and ready to
diffuse prosperity and to end hard times. Tyler,
formerly a strict constructionist member of the
Jackson party, was nominated to catch votes, in
spite of his perfectly well known opposition to the
whole Whig theory of government.</p>

<p>The Democratic, or Democratic-Republican, convention
met at Baltimore on May 5, 1840. The
party name was now definitely and exclusively
adopted. Among the delegates were men long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
afterwards famous in the later Republican party,
John A. Dix, Hannibal Hamlin, Simon Cameron.
There was an air of despondency about the convention,
for the enthusiasm over "log cabin and
hard cider" was already abroad. But the convention
without wavering announced its belief in a
limited federal power, in the separation of public
moneys from banking institutions; and its opposition
to internal improvements by the nation, to
the federal assumption of state debts, to the fostering
of one industry so as to injure another, to
raising more money than was required for necessary
expenses of government, and to a national
bank. Slavery now took for a long time its place
in the party platform. The convention declared
the constitutional inability of Congress to interfere
with slavery in the States, and that all efforts of
abolitionists to induce Congress to interfere with
slavery were alarming and dangerous to the Union.
An elaborate address to the people was issued. It
began with a clear, and for a political campaign a
reasonably moderate, defense of Van Buren's administration;
it renewed the well-worn arguments
for the limited activity of government; it made a
silly assertion that Harrison was a Federalist, and
an insinuation that the glory of his military career
was doubtful; it denounced the abolitionists, whose
fanaticism it charged the Whigs with enlisting in
their cause. In closing, it recalled the Democratic
revolution of 1800 which broke the "iron rod of
Federal rule," and contrasted the "costly and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
stately pageants addressed merely to the senses"
by the Whigs with the truth and reason of the
Democracy.</p>

<p>During the canvass Van Buren submitted to
frequent interrogation. In a fashion that would
seem fatal to a modern candidate, he wrote to
political friends and enemies alike, letter after letter,
restating his political opinions. Especially
was it sought to arouse Southern distrust of him.
He was accused, with fire-eating anger, of having
approved a sentence of a court-martial against a
naval lieutenant which was based upon the testimony
of negroes. He reiterated what he had
already said upon slavery; but late in the canvass
he went one step further. When asked his opinion
as to the treatment by Congress of the abolition
petitions, he replied, justly enough, that the President
could have no concern with that matter; but
lest he should be charged with "non-committalism,"
he declared that Congress was fully justified
in adopting the "gag" rule. For years the petitions
had been received and referred. On one
occasion in each House the subject had been considered
upon a report of a committee, and decided
against the petitioners with almost entire unanimity.
The rule had been adopted only after it
was clear that the petitioners simply sought to
make Congress an instrument of an agitation which
might lead to a dissolution of the Union. It was
thus that Van Buren made his extreme concession
to the slavocracy. And there was obvious a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
material excuse. No president while in office could
approve the perversion of legislative procedure from
the making of laws to be a mere stimulant of moral
excitement. To encourage or justify petitions intended
to inflame public sentiment against a wrong
might be legitimate for some men, however well
they knew, as Adams said he knew, that the body
addressed ought not to grant the petitioners' prayers.
Such a course might be noble and praiseworthy
for a private citizen, or possibly for a
member of Congress representing the exalted moral
sentiment of a single district. It would be highly
illegitimate for a man holding a great public office,
and there representing the entire people and its
established system of laws. John Quincy Adams,
under his sense of duty as president, had in 1828
pressed the humiliating claim that England should
surrender American slaves escaped to English freedom;
and there is little reason to doubt that, if he
had remained in the field of responsible and executive
public life, he would have agreed with Van
Buren in his treatment of the matter of the abolition
petitions, or rather in his expressions from the
White House about them.</p>

<p>Harrison hastened to clear his skirts of abolitionism.
Congress could not, he declared, abolish
slavery in the District of Columbia without the
consent of Virginia and Maryland and of the District
itself. For, as he argued, ignobly applying,
as well as misquoting, the American words solemnly
lauded by Lord Chatham in his speech on Quarter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>ing
Soldiers in Boston, "what a man has honestly
acquired is absolutely his own, which he may freely
give, but which cannot be taken from him without
his consent." He denounced as a slander the
charge that he was an abolitionist, or that the vote
he had given against anti-slavery restriction in
Missouri had violated his conscience. He declared
for the right of petition, which indeed nobody disputed;
but he did not say what course should be
taken with the anti-slavery petitions, which was the
real question to be answered. The discussion by
the citizens of the free States of slavery in the
slave States was not, he said, "sanctioned by the
Constitution." "Methinks," he said at Dayton,
"I hear a soft voice asking, Are you in favor of
paper money? I am;" and to that there were
"shouts of applause."</p>

<p>In no presidential canvass in America has there
been, as Mr. Schurz well says in his life of Henry
Clay, "more enthusiasm and less thought" than
in the Whig canvass of 1840. The people were
rushing as from a long restraint. Wise saws
about the duties of government had become nauseating.
A plain every-day man administering
a paternal and affectionate government was the
ruling text, while Tyler and his strict construction
quietly served their turn with some of the doctrinaires
at the South. The nation, Clay said, was
"like the ocean when convulsed by some terrible
storm." There was what he called a "rabid appetite
for public discussions."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster's campaign speeches probably marked
the height of the splendid and effectual flood of
eloquence now poured over the land. The breeze
of popular excitement, he said, with satisfactory
magniloquence, was flowing everywhere; it fanned
the air in Alabama and the Carolinas; and crossing
the Potomac and the Alleghanies, to mingle
with the gales of the Empire State and the mountain
blasts of New England, would blow a perfect
hurricane. "Every breeze," he declared, "says
change; the cry, the universal cry, is for a change."
He had not, indeed, been born in a log cabin, but
his elder brothers and sisters had; he wept to
think of those who had left it; and if he failed in
affectionate veneration for him who raised it, then
might his name and the name of his posterity be
blotted from the memory of mankind. He touched
the bank question lightly; he denounced the sub-treasury
as "the first in a new series of ruthless
experiments," and declared that Van Buren's
"abandonment of the currency" was fatal. Forgetting
who had supported and who had opposed
the continued distribution of surplus revenues
among the States, he condemned the President
for the low state of the treasury; and notwithstanding
it declared his approval of a generous
policy of internal improvements. He would not
accuse the President of seeking to play the part of
C&aelig;sar or Cromwell because Mr. Poinsett, his secretary
of war, had recommended a federal organization
of militia, the necessity or convenience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
which, it was supposed, had been demonstrated by
the Canadian troubles; but the plan, he said, was
expensive, unconstitutional, and dangerous to our
liberties. He was careful to say nothing of slavery
or the right of petition. Only in brief and casual
sentences did he even touch the charges that Van
Buren had treated political contests as "rightfully
struggles for office and emolument," and that federal
officers had been assessed in proportion to
their salaries for partisan purposes. The President
was pictured as full of cynical and selfish disregard
of the people; he had disparaged the credit
of the States; he had accused Madison, and, monstrous
sacrilege, even Washington, of corruption.
"I may forgive this," Webster slowly said to the
appalled audience, "but I shall not forget it;"
such "abominable violations of the truth of history"
filled his bosom with "burning scorn."
This was a highly imaginative allusion to Van
Buren's statement that the national bank had been
originally devised by the friends of privileged
orders. Nor need the South, even Webster intimated,
have any fear of the Whigs about slavery.
Could the South believe that Harrison would "lay
ruthless hands on the institutions among which he
was born and educated?" No, indeed, for Washington
and Hancock, Virginia and Massachusetts,
had joined their thoughts, their hopes, their feelings.
"How many bones of Northern men," he
asked with majestic pathos, "lie at Yorktown?"
Senator Rives, now one of the Conservatives, said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
that Van Buren was indeed "mild, smooth, affable,
smiling;" but humility was "young and old
ambition's ladder." The militia project meant
military usurpation. Look at Cromwell, he said;
look at Bonaparte. Were their usurpations not in
the name of the people? Preston of South Carolina
said that Van Buren had advocated diminished
wages to others; now he should himself receive
diminished wages. Harrison was, he said "a
Southern man with Southern principles." As for
Van Buren, this "Northern man with Southern
principles," did he not come "from beyond the
Hudson," had he not been "a friend of Rufus
King, a Missouri restrictionist, a friend and advocate
of free negro suffrage?" Clay said that it
was no time "to argue;" a rule his party for the
moment well observed. The nation had already
pronounced upon the ravages Van Buren had
brought upon the land, the general and widespread
ruin, the broken hopes. With the mere
fact of Harrison's election, "without reference to
the measures of his administration," he told the
Virginians at Hanover, "confidence will immediately
revive, credit be restored, active business
will return, prices of products will rise; and the
people will feel and know that, instead of their
servants being occupied in devising measures for
their ruin and destruction, they will be assiduously
employed in promoting their welfare and prosperity."</p>

<p>All this was far more glorious than the brutally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
true advice of the old man with a broad-axe on his
shoulders, whom the Democrats quoted. When
asked what was to become of everybody in the
heavy distress of the panic, he answered, "Damn
the panic! If you would all work as I do, you
would have no panic." The people no longer
cared about "the interested few who desire to enrich
themselves by the use of public money." If,
as the Democrats said, the interested few had been
thwarted, an almost universal poverty had for
some reason or other come with their defeat.
Perhaps the reflecting citizen thought that he
might become, if he were not already, one of the
"interested few." Nor was the demagogy all on
the side of the Whigs, although they enjoyed the
more popular quality of the quadrennial product.
Van Buren himself, in the futile fashion of aging
parties which suppose that their ancient victories
still stir the popular heart, recalled "the reign of
terror" of the elder Adams, and how the "Samson
of Democracy burst the cords which were already
bound around its limbs," how "a web more artfully
contrived, composed of a high protective
tariff, a system of internal improvements, and a
national bank, was then twined around the sleeping
giant" until he was "roused by the warning
voice of the honest and intrepid Jackson." Harrison's
own numerous speeches were awkward and
indefinite enough; but still they showed an honest
and sincere man, and in the enthusiasm of the
day they did him no harm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>The revolts against the severe party discipline
of the Democracy, aided by the popular distress,
were serious. Calhoun, indeed, had returned; but
all his supporters did not return with him. The
Southern defection headed by White in 1836 was
still most formidable, and was now re&euml;nforced by
the Conservative secession North and South.
Even Major Eaton forgot Van Buren's gallantry
ten years before, and joined the enemy. The talk
of "spoils" was amply justified; but the abuses
of patronage had not prevented Jackson's popularity,
and under Van Buren they were far less
serious. This cry did not yet touch the American
people. The most serious danger of "spoils" still
lay in the future. Patronage abuses had injured
the efficiency of the public service, but they had
not yet begun to defeat the popular will. Jackson
came resolutely to Van Buren's aid in the fashionable
letter-writing. "The Rives Conservatives,
the Abolitionists and Federalists" had combined,
the ex-President vivaciously said, to obtain power
"by falsehood and slander of the basest kind;"
but the "virtue of the people," he declared in
what from other lips would have seemed cant,
would defeat "the money power." Van Buren's
firmness and ability entitled him, he thought, to a
rank not inferior to Jefferson or Madison, while
he rather unhandsomely added that he had never
admired Harrison as a military man.</p>

<p>The Whig campaign was highly picturesque.
Meetings were measured by "acres of men."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
They gathered on the field of Tippecanoe. Revolutionary
soldiers marched in venerable processions.
Wives and daughters came with their
husbands and fathers. There were the barrel of
cider, the coon-skins, and the log cabin with the
live raccoon running over it and the latch-string
hung out; for Harrison had told his soldiers when
he left them, that never should his door be shut,
"or the string of the latch pulled in." Van
Buren meantime, with an aristocratic sneer upon
his face, was seated in an English carriage, after
feeding himself from the famous gold spoons
bought for the White House. Harrison was a
hunter who had caught a fox before and would
again; one of the county processions from Pennsylvania
boasted, "Old Mother Cumberland&mdash;she'll
bag the fox." Illinois would "teach the
palace slaves to respect the log cabin." "Down
with the wages, say the administration." "Matty's
policy, fifty cents a day and French soup;
our policy, two dollars a day and roastbeef."
Newspapers were full of advertisements like this:
"The subscriber will pay $5 a hundred for pork
if Harrison is elected, and $2.50 if Van Buren is."</p>

<p>But the songs were most interesting. The ball,
which Benton had said in his last speech on the
expunging resolution that he "solitary and alone"
had put in motion, was a mine of similes. They
sang:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"With heart and soul</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">This ball we roll."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"As rolls the ball,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Van's reign does fall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And he may look</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To Kinderhook."</span><br />
<br />
"The gathering ball is rolling still,<br />
And still gathering as it rolls."<br />
</p>

<p>Harrison's battle with the Indians gave the effective
cry of "Tippecanoe and Tyler too." And
so they sang:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Farewell, dear Van,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">You're not our man;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To guard the ship,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We'll try old Tip."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"With Tip and Tyler</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We'll burst Van's biler."</span><br />
<br />
"Old Tip he wears a homespun suit,<br />
He has no ruffled shirt&mdash;wirt&mdash;wirt;<br />
But Mat he has the golden plate,<br />
And he's a little squirt&mdash;wirt&mdash;wirt."<br />
</p>

<p>When the election returns began to come from
the August and September States, the joyful excitement
passed all bounds. Then the new Whigs
found a new Lilliburlero. To the tune of the
"Little Pig's Tail" they sang:</p>

<p class="poem">
"What has caused this great commotion, motion, motion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Our country through?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">It is the ball a-rolling on,</span><br />
For Tippecanoe and Tyler too, Tippecanoe and Tyler too!<br />
<br />
"And with them we'll beat little Van, Van;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Van is a used-up man.</span><br />
Oh, have you heard the news from Maine, Maine, Maine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">All honest and true?</span><br />
One thousand for Kent and seven thousand gain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">For Tippecanoe," etc.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>And then Joe Hoxie would close the meetings
by singing "Up Salt River."</p>

<p>The result was pretty plain before November.
New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and
Virginia voted for state officers in the spring. All
had voted for Van Buren in 1836; all now gave
Whig majorities, except New Hampshire, where
the Democratic majority was greatly reduced. In
August North Carolina was added to the Whig
column, though in Missouri and Illinois there was
little change. But when in September Maine,
which had given Van Buren nearly eight thousand
majority, and had since remained steadfast, "went
hell-bent for Governor Kent" and gave a slight
Whig majority, the administration's doom was
sealed.</p>

<p>Harrison received 234 electoral votes, and Van
Buren 60. New York gave Harrison 13,300 votes
more than Van Buren; but a large part of this
plurality, perhaps all, came from the counties on
the northern and western borders. Only one
Northern State, Illinois, voted for Van Buren. Of
the slave States, five, Virginia, South Carolina,
Alabama, Missouri, and Arkansas, were for Van
Buren; the other eight for Harrison. There was
a popular majority in the slave States of about
55,000 against Van Buren in a total vote of about
695,000, and in the free States, of about 90,000 in
a total vote of about 1,700,000, still showing, therefore,
his greater popular strength in the free States.
The increase in the popular vote was the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
extraordinary the country has ever known, proving
the depth and universality of the feeling. This
vote had been about 1,500,000 in 1836; it reached
about 2,400,000 in 1840, an increase of 900,000,
while from 1840 to the Clay canvass of 1844 it
increased only 300,000. Van Buren, as a defeated
candidate in 1840, received about 350,000 votes
more than elected him in 1836; and the growth of
population in the four years was probably less, not
greater, than usual. There were cries of "fraud
and corruption" because of this enormously increased
vote, cries which Benton long afterwards
seriously heeded; but there seems to be no good
reason to treat them otherwise than as one of the
many expressions of Democratic anguish.</p>

<p>Van Buren received the seemingly crushing defeat
with dignity and composure. While the cries
of "Van, Van, he's a used-up man," were coming
with some of the sting of truth through the White
House windows, he prepared the final message with
which he met Congress in December, 1840. The
year, he said, had been one of "health, plenty,
and peace." Again he declared the dangers of a
national debt, and the equal dangers of too much
money in the treasury; for "practical economy in
the management of public affairs," he said, "can
have no adverse influence to contend with more
powerful than a large surplus revenue." Again
he attacked the national bank scheme. During
four years of the greatest pecuniary embarrassments
ever known in time of peace, with a decreas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>ing
public revenue, with a formidable opposition,
his administration had been able punctually to meet
every obligation without a bank, without a permanent
national debt, and without incurring any
liability which the ordinary resources of the government
would not speedily discharge. If the
public service had been thus independently sustained
without either of these fruitful sources of
discord, had we not a right to expect that this
policy would "receive the final sanction of a people
whose unbiased and fairly elicited judgment upon
public affairs is never ultimately wrong?" Again
with a clear emphasis he declared against any attempt
of the government to repair private losses
sustained in private business, either by direct appropriations
or by legislation designed to secure
exclusive privileges to individuals or classes. In
the very last words of this, his last message, he
gave an account of his efforts to suppress the slave
trade, and to prevent "the prostitution of the
American flag to this inhuman purpose," asking
Congress, by a prohibition of the American trade
which took supplies to the slave factories on the
African coast, to break up "those dens of iniquity."</p>

<p>The short session of Congress was hardly more
than a jubilee of the Whigs, happily ignorant of
the complete chagrin and frustration of their hopes
which a few months would bring. Some new bank
suspensions occurred in Philadelphia, and among
banks closely connected with that city. The Bank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
of the United States, after a resumption for twenty
days, succumbed amid its own loud protestations
of solvency, its final disgrace and ruin being, however,
deferred a little longer.</p>

<p>Van Buren's cabinet had somewhat changed
since his inauguration. In 1838 his old friend
and ally, and one of the chief champions of his
policy, Benjamin F. Butler, resigned the office of
attorney-general, but without any break political
or personal, as was seen in his fine and arduous
labors in the canvass of 1840 and in the Democratic
convention of 1844. Felix Grundy of Tennessee
then held the place until late in 1839, when
he resigned. Van Buren offered it, though without
much heartiness, to James Buchanan, who preferred,
however, to retain his seat in the Senate;
and Henry D. Gilpin, another Pennsylvanian, was
appointed. Amos Kendall's enormous industry
and singular equipment of doctrinaire convictions,
narrow prejudices, executive ability, and practical
political skill and craft, were lost to the administration
through the failure of his health in the
midst of the campaign of 1840. In an address to
the public he gave a curious proof that for him
work was more wearing in public than in private
service. He stated that as he was poor he should
resort to private employment suitable to his health;
and that he proposed, therefore, during the canvass
to write for the "Globe" in defense of the President,
in whose integrity, principles, and firmness his
confidence, he said, had increased. In 1838, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
his health had threatened to be unequal to his
work, Van Buren had offered him the mission to
Spain, if it should become vacant. John M. Niles,
formerly a Democratic senator from Connecticut,
took Kendall's place in the post-office.</p>

<p>Van Buren welcomed Harrison to the White
House, and before the inauguration entertained
him there as a guest, with the easy and dignified
courtesy so natural to him, and in marked contrast
to the absence of social amenities on either side at
the great change twelve years before. Under Van
Buren indeed the executive mansion was administered
with elevated grace. There was about it,
while he was its master, the unostentatious elegance
suited to the dwelling of the chief magistrate
of the great republic. There were many
flings at him for his great economy, and what was
called his parsimony; but he was accused as well
of undemocratic luxury. The talk seemed never
to end over the gold spoons. The contradictory
charges point out the truth. Van Buren was an
eminently prudent man. He did not indulge in
the careless and useless waste which impoverished
Jefferson and Jackson. By sensible and honorable
economy he is said to have saved one half of the
salary of $25,000 a year then paid to the President.<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Returning to private life, he was spared the
humiliation of pecuniary trouble, which had dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>tressed
three at least of his predecessors. But
with his exquisite sense of propriety, he had not
failed to order the White House with fitting decorum
and a modest state. His son Abraham
Van Buren was his private secretary; and after
the latter's marriage, in November, 1838, to Miss
Singleton of South Carolina, a niece of Andrew
Stevenson, and a relation of Mrs. Madison, he and
his wife formed the presidential family. In 1841
they accompanied the ex-President to his retirement
at Lindenwald.</p>

<p>Under Andrew Jackson the social air of the
White House had suffered from his ill-health and
the bitterness of his partisanship; and in this respect
the change to his successor was most pleasing.
Van Buren used an agreeable tact with even
his strongest opponents; and about his levees and
receptions there were a charm and a grace by no
means usual in the dwellings of American public
men. He had, we are told in the Recollections of
Sargent, a political adversary of his, "the high
art of blending dignity with ease and gravity."
He introduced the custom of dining with the heads
of departments and foreign ministers, although
with that exception he observed the etiquette of
never being the guest of others at Washington.
Judge Story mentions the "splendid dinner" given
by the President to the judges in January, 1839.</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams's diary bears unintended
testimony to Van Buren's admirable personal bearing
in office. From the time he reached Washing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>ton
as secretary of state, he had treated Adams in
his defeat with marked distinction and deference,
which Adams, as he records, accepted in his own
house, in the White House, and elsewhere. At a
social party the President, he said, "was, as usual,
courteous to all, and particularly to me." Van
Buren had therefore every reason to suppose that
there was between himself and Adams a not unfriendly
personal esteem. But Adams, in his churlish,
bitter temper, apparently found in these wise
and generous civilities only evidence of a mean
spirit. After one visit at the White House during
the height of the crisis of 1837, he recorded that
he found Van Buren looking, not wretched, as he
had been told, but composed and tranquil. Returning
home from this observation of the President's
"calmness, his gentleness of manner, his easy and
conciliatory temper," this often unmannerly pen
described besides "his obsequiousness, his sycophancy,
his profound dissimulation and duplicity,
... his fawning civility." In a passage which
was remarkable in that time of political bitterness
so largely personal, Clay said, in his parliamentary
duel with Calhoun, after the latter rejoined the
Democratic party, that he remembered Calhoun
attributing to the President the qualities of "the
most crafty, most skulking, and the meanest of the
quadruped tribe." Saying that he had not shared
Calhoun's opinion, he then added of Van Buren:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have always found him in his manner and deportment,
civil, courteous, and gentlemanly; and he dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>penses
in the noble mansion which he now occupies,
one worthy the residence of the chief magistrate of a
great people, a generous and liberal hospitality. An
acquaintance with him of more than twenty years' duration
has inspired me with a respect for the man, although
I regret to be compelled to say, I detest the
magistrate."</p></div>

<span class="ft80">EX-PRESIDENT.&mdash;SLAVERY.&mdash;TEXAS ANNEXATION.&mdash;DEFEAT
BY THE SOUTH.&mdash;FREE-SOIL CAMPAIGN.&mdash;LAST YEARS</span></h2>


<p>Van Buren loitered at Washington a few days
after his presidency was over, and on his way home
stopped at Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York.
At New York he was finely welcomed. Amid
great crowds he was taken to the City Hall in a
procession headed by Captain Brown's corps of
lancers and a body of armed firemen. He reached
Kinderhook on May 15, 1841, there to make his
home until his death. He had, after the seemly
and pleasing fashion of many men in American
public life, lately purchased, near this village
among the hills of Columbia county, the residence
of William P. Van Ness, where Irving had thirty
years before lived in seclusion after the death of
his betrothed, and had put the last touches to his
Knickerbocker. It was an old estate, whose lands
had been rented for twenty years and under cultivation
for a hundred and sixty, and from which
Van Buren now managed to secure a profit. To
this seat he gave the name of Lindenwald, a name
which in secret he probably hoped the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
people would come to group with Monticello, Montpellier,
and the Hermitage. But this could not be.
Van Buren had served but half the presidential
term of honor. He was not a sage, but still a candidate
for the presidency. Before the electoral
votes were counted in 1841, Benton declared for
his renomination in 1844; and until the latter
year he again held the interesting and powerful
but critical place of the probable candidate of his
party for the presidency. He remained easily the
chief figure in the Democratic ranks. His defeat
had not taken from him that honor which is the
property of the statesman standing for a cause
whose righteousness and promise belong to the
assured future. His defeat signified no personal,
no political fault. It had come to him from a widespread
convulsion for which, perhaps less than any
great American of his time, he was responsible.
His party could not abandon its battle for a limited
and non-paternal government and against the use
of public moneys by private persons. It could
not therefore abandon him; for more than any
other man who had not now finally retired he
represented these causes in his own person. But
his easy composure of manner did not altogether
hide that eating and restless anxiety which so often
attends the supreme ambition of the American.</p>

<p>Two days after leaving the White House, Van
Buren said, in reply to complimentary resolutions
of the legislature of Missouri, that he did not utterly
lament the bitter attacks upon him; for expe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>rience
had taught him that few political men were
praised by their foes until they were about abandoning
their friends. With a pleasing frankness he
admitted that to be worthy of the presidency and
to reach it had been the object of his "most earnest
desire;" but he said that the selection of the next
Democratic candidate must be decided by its probable
effect upon the principles for which they had
just fought, and not upon any supposition that he
had been wounded or embittered by his defeat
in their defense. His description of a candidate
meant himself, however, and rightly enough. In
November, 1841, he wrote of the "apparent success
of last year's buffoonery;" and intimated
that, though he would take no step to be a candidate,
it was not true that he had said he should
decline a nomination.</p>

<p>Early in 1842, the ex-President made a trip
through the South, in company with James K.
Paulding, visiting on his return Clay at Ashland,
and Jackson at the Hermitage. He was one of
the very few men on personally friendly terms with
both those long-time enemies. At Ashland, doubtless,
Texas was talked over, even if a bargain were
not made, as has been fancied, that Clay and Van
Buren should remove the troublesome question from
politics. In a fashion very different from that of
modern candidates, he now wrote, from time to
time, able, long, and explicit, but somewhat tedious
letters on political questions. In one of them he
touched protection more clearly than ever before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
He favored, he said in February, 1843, a tariff for
revenue only; the "incidental protection" which
that must give many American manufacturers was
all the protection which should be permitted; the
mechanics and laborers had been the chief sufferers
from a "high protective tariff." He was at last
and definitely "a low tariff man." He declared
that he should support the Democratic candidate
of 1844; for he believed it to be impossible that a
selection from that source should not accord with
his views. He did not perhaps realize to how
extreme a test his sincerity would be put. He
added words which four years later read strangely
enough. "My name and pretensions," he said,
"however subordinate in importance, shall never
be at the disposal of any person whatever, for the
purpose of creating distractions or divisions in the
Democratic party."</p>

<p>The party was indeed known as the "Van Buren
party" until 1844, so nearly universal was the
supposition that he was to be renominated, and so
plainly was he its leader. The disasters which
had now overtaken the Whigs made his return to
power seem probable enough. The utterly incongruous
elements held together during the sharp
discontent and wonderful but inarticulate enthusiasm
of 1840 had quickly fallen apart. While on
his way to Kinderhook Van Buren was the chief
figure in the obsequies at New York of his successful
competitor. This honest man, of whom John
Quincy Adams said, with his usual savage exagge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>ration,
that his dull sayings were repeated for wit
and his grave inanity passed off for wisdom, had
already quarreled with the splendid leader whose
place he was too conscious of usurping. Tyler's
accession was the first, but not the last illustration,
which American politicians have had of the danger
of securing the presidency by an award of the
second place to a known opponent of the principles
whose success they seek. Tyler had not before his
nomination concealed his narrow and Democratic
views of government. The Whigs had ostentatiously
refused to declare any principles when they
nominated him. In technical conscientiousness he
marched with a step by no means cowardly to unhonored
political isolation, as a quarter of a century
later marched another vice-president nominated by
a party in whose ranks he too was a new recruit.</p>

<p>Upon Tyler's veto of the bill for a national bank,
an outcry of agony went up from the Whigs; the
whole cabinet, except Webster, resigned; a new
cabinet was formed, partly from the Conservatives;
and by 1844, Tyler was a forlorn candidate for the
Democratic nomination, which he claimed for his
support of the annexation of Texas.</p>

<p>Upon this first of the great pro-slavery movements
Van Buren was defeated for the Democratic
nomination in 1844, although it seemed assured to
him by every consideration of party loyalty, obligation,
and wise foresight. The relations of government
to private business ceased to be the dominant
political question a few months and only a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
months too soon to enable Van Buren to complete
his eight years. Slavery arose in place of economics.</p>

<p>No mistake is more common in the review of
American history than to suppose that slavery was
an active or definite force in organized American
politics after the Missouri Compromise and before
the struggle for the annexation of Texas under
Tyler's administration. The appeals of the abolitionists
to the simpler and deeper feelings of humanity
were indeed at work before 1835; and
from that year on they were profoundly stirring
the American conscience and storing up tremendous
moral energy. But slavery was not in partisan
politics. In 1836 and 1840 there was upon
slavery no real difference between the utterances
of the candidates and other leaders, Whig and
Democratic, whether North or South. Van Buren
was supported by many abolitionists; the profoundest
distrust of him was at the South. Upon
no question touching slavery with which the president
could have concern, did his opinions or his utterances
differ from those of John Quincy Adams.
Clay said in November, 1838, that the abolitionists
denounced him as a slaveholder and the slaveholders
denounced him as an abolitionist, while both
united on Van Buren. The charge of truckling
to the South, traditionally made against Van Buren,
is justified by no utterance or act different from
those made by all American public men of distinction
at the time, except perhaps in two instances,&mdash;his
vote as vice-president for Kendall's bill against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
sending inflammatory abolition circulars through
the post-office to States which prohibited their circulation,
and his approval of the rules in the Senate
and House for tabling or refusing abolition petitions
without reading them. But neither of these,
as has been shown, was a decisive test. In the
first case he met a political trick; and for his vote
there was justly much to be said on the reason of
the thing, apart from Southern wishes. As late as
1848, Webster, in criticising Van Buren's inconsistency,
would say no more of the law than that
it was one "of very doubtful propriety;" and declared
that he himself should agree to legislation
by Congress to protect the South "from incitements
to insurrection." In the second case Van
Buren's position in public life might of itself properly
restrain him from acquiescing in an agitation
in Congress for measures which, with all responsible
public men, Adams included, he believed Congress
ought not to pass.</p>

<p>The Democratic convention was to meet in May,
1844. The delegates had been very generally instructed
for Van Buren; and two months before
it assembled his nomination seemed beyond doubt.
But the slave States were now fired with a barbarous
enthusiasm to extend slavery by annexing
Texas. To this Van Buren was supposed to
be hostile. His Southern opponents, in February,
1843, skillfully procured from Jackson, innocent of
the plan, a strong letter in favor of the annexation,
to be used, it was said, just before the convention,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
"to blow Van out of water." The letter was first
published in March, 1844. Van Buren was at
once put to a crucial test. His administration had
been adverse to annexation; his opinion was still
adverse. But a large, and not improbably a controlling
section of his party, aided by Jackson's
wonderful prestige, deemed it the most important
of political causes. Van Buren was, according to
the plan, explicitly asked by a Southern delegate
to state, with distinct reference to the action of
the convention, what were his opinions.</p>

<p>The ex-President deeply desired the nomination;
and the nomination seemed conditioned upon his
surrender. It was at least assured if he now gave
no offense to the South. But he did not flinch.
He resorted to no safe generalizations. His views
upon the annexation were, he admitted, different
from those of many friends, political and personal;
but in 1837 his administration after a careful
consideration had decided against annexation of the
State whose independence had lately been recognized
by the United States; the situation had not
changed; immediate annexation would place a weapon
in the hands of those who looked upon Americans
and American institutions with distrustful and
envious eyes, and would do us far more real and
lasting injury than the new territory, however valuable,
could repair. He intimated that there was
jobbery in some of the enthusiasm for the annexation.
The argument that England might acquire
Texas was without force; when England sought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
in Texas more than the usual commercial favors, it
would be time for the United States to interfere.
He was aware, he said, of the hazard to which he
exposed his standing with his Southern fellow-citizens,
"of whom it was aptly and appropriately
said by one of their own number that 'they are the
children of the sun and partake of its warmth.'"
But whether we stand or fall, he said, it is always
true wisdom as well as true morality to hold fast
to the truth. If to nourish enthusiasm were one of
the effects of a genial climate, it seldom failed to
give birth to a chivalrous spirit. To preserve our
national escutcheon untarnished had always been
the unceasing solicitude of Southern statesmen.
The only tempering he gave his refusal was to say
that if, after the subject had been fully discussed,
a Congress chosen with reference to the question
showed the popular will to favor it, he would yield.<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>Van Buren thus closed his letter: "Nor can I in
any extremity be induced to cast a shade over
the motives of my past life, by changes or concealments
of opinions maturely formed upon a great
national question, for the unworthy purpose of increasing
my chances for political promotion."</p>

<p>To a presidential candidate the eve of a national
convention is dim with the self-deceiving twilight
of sophistry; and the twilight deepens when a question
is put upon which there is a division among
those who are, or who may be, his supporters. He
can keep silence, he can procure the questioning
friend to withdraw the troublesome inquiry; he
can ignore the question from an enemy; he can
affect an enigmatical dignity. Van Buren did
neither of these. His Texas letter was one of the
finest and bravest pieces of political courage, and
deserves from Americans a long admiration.</p>

<p>The danger of Van Buren's difference with Jackson
it was sought to avert. Butler visited Jackson
at the Hermitage, and doubtless showed him for
what a sinister end he had been used. Jackson
did not withdraw his approval of annexation; but
publicly declared his regard for Van Buren to be
so great, his confidence in Van Buren's love of
country to be so strengthened by long intimacy,
that no difference about Texas could change his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>opinions. Van Buren's nomination was again
widely supposed to be assured. But the work of
Calhoun and Robert J. Walker had been too well
done. The convention met at Baltimore on May
27, 1844. George Bancroft headed the delegation
from Massachusetts. Before the Rev. Dr. Johns
had "fervently addressed the Throne of Grace"
or the Rev. Mr. McJilton had "read a scripture
lesson," the real contest took place over the
adoption of the rule requiring a two thirds vote
for a nomination. For it was through this rule
that enough Southern members, chosen before Van
Buren's letter as they had been, were to escape
obedience to their instructions to vote for him.
Robert J. Walker, then a senator from Mississippi,
a man of interesting history and large ability, led
the Southerners. He quoted the precedent of 1832,
when Van Buren had been nominated for the vice-presidency
under the two thirds rule, and that of
1835, when he had been nominated for the presidency.
These nominations had led to victory. In
1840 the rule had not been adopted. Without
this rule, he said amid angry excitement, the party
would yield to those whose motto seemed to be
"rule or ruin." Butler, Daniel S. Dickinson, and
Marcus Morton led the Northern ranks. Butler
regretted that any member should condescend to
the allusion to 1840. That year, he said, had been
a debauchery of the nation's reason amid log cabins,
hard cider, and coon-skins; and in an ecstasy of
painful excitement at the recollection and amid a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
tremendous burst of applause "he leaped from the
floor and stamped ... as if treading beneath his
feet the object of his loathing." The true Democratic
rule, he continued, required the minority to
submit to the majority. Morton said that under
the majority rule Jefferson had been nominated;
that rule had governed state, county, and township
conventions. Butler admitted that under the rule
Van Buren would not be nominated, although a
majority of the convention was known to be for
him. In 1832 and 1835 the two thirds rule had
prevailed because it was certainly known who would
be nominated; and the rule operated to aid not to
defeat the majority. If the rule were adopted, it
would be by the votes of States which were not
Democratic, and would bring "dismemberment and
final breaking up of the party." Walker laughed
at Butler's "tall vaulting" from the floor; and,
refusing to shrink from the Van Buren issue, he
protested against New York dictation, and warningly
said that, if Van Buren were nominated,
Clay would be elected. After the convention had
received with enthusiasm a floral gift from a Democratic
lady whom the President declared to be
fairer than the flowers, the vote was taken. The
two thirds rule was adopted by 148 to 118. All
the negatives were Northerners, except 14 from
Missouri, Maryland, and North Carolina. Fifty-eight
true "Northern men with Southern principles"
joined ninety Southerners in the affirmative.
It was really a vote on Van Buren,&mdash;or rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
upon the annexation of Texas,&mdash;or rather still
upon the extension of American slave territory. It
was the first battle, a sort of Bull Run, in the last
and great political campaign between the interests
of slavery and those of freedom.</p>

<p>On the first ballot for the candidate, Van Buren
had 146 votes, 13 more than a majority. If after
the vote on the two thirds rule anything more were
required to show that some of these votes were
given in mere formal obedience to instructions, the
second ballot brought the proof. Van Buren then
sank to 127, less than a majority; and on the
seventh ballot to 99. A motion was made to declare
him the nominee as the choice of a majority
of the convention; and there followed a scene of
fury, the President bawling for order amid savage
taunts between North and South, and bitter denunciations
of the treachery of some of those who
had pledged themselves for Van Buren. Samuel
Young of New York declared the "abominable
Texas question" to be the fire-brand thrown among
them by the "mongrel administration at Washington,"
whose hero was now doubtless fiddling while
Rome was burning. Nero seems to have been Calhoun,
though between the god-like young devil of
antiquity wreathed with sensual frenzy and infamy,
and the solemn, even saturnine figure of the great
modern advocate of human slavery, the likeness
seemed rather slight. The motion was declared
out of order; and the name of James K. Polk was
presented as that of "a pure whole-hogged Demo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>crat."
On the eighth ballot he had 44 votes. Then
followed the magnanimous scene of "union and
harmony" which has so often, after a conflict,
charmed a political body into unworthy surrender.
The great delegation from New York retired during
the ninth balloting; and returned to a convention
profoundly silent but thrilling with that bastard
sense of coming glory in which a lately tumultuous
and quarreling body waits the solution of its difficulties
already known to be reached but not yet
declared. Butler quoted a letter which Van Buren
had given him authorizing the withdrawal of his
name if it were necessary for harmony; he eulogized
Polk as a strict constructionist, and closed
by reading a letter from Jackson fervently urging
Van Buren's nomination. Daniel S. Dickinson
said that "he loved this convention because it had
acted so like the masses," and cast New York's 35
votes for Polk. The latter's nomination was declared
with the utmost joy, and sent to Washington
over Morse's first telegraph line, just completed.
Silas Wright of New York, Van Buren's strong
friend and a known opponent of annexation, was,
in the fashion since followed, nominated for the
vice-presidency, to soothe the feelings and the conscience
of the defeated. Wright peremptorily telegraphed
his refusal. He told his friends that he
did "not choose to ride behind on the black pony."
George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania took his place.</p>

<p>The Democratic party now threw away all
advantage of the issue made by the undeserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
defeat four years before. Thirty-six years later it
repeated the blunder in discarding Van Buren's
famous neighbor and disciple. Polk's was the
first nomination by the party of a man of the
second or of even a lower rank. Polk was known
to have ability inferior not only to that of Van
Buren and Calhoun, but to Cass, Buchanan,
Wright, and others. He was the first presidential
"dark horse," and indeed hardly that. His
own State of Tennessee had, by resolution, presented
him as its choice for vice-president with
Van Buren in the first place. He had been
speaker of the national House, and later, governor
of his State; but since holding these places had
been twice defeated for governor. In accepting
the nomination he declared, with an apparent
fling at Van Buren, that, if elected, he should not
accept a renomination, and should thus enable the
party in 1848 to make "a free selection."</p>

<p>The nomination aroused disgust enough. "Polk!
Great God, what a nomination!" Letcher, the
Whig governor of Kentucky, wrote to Buchanan.
But the experiment of 1840 with the Whigs had
been disastrous; the people had swung back to
the strict doctrines of the Democracy. Van Buren
faithfully kept his promise to support the
nomination; under his urgency Wright finally accepted
the nomination for governor of New York.
And by the vote of New York Henry Clay was
defeated by a man vastly his inferior. Polk had
5000 plurality in that State; but Wright had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
10,000. Had not James G. Birney, the abolitionist
candidate who polled there 15,812 votes,
been in the field, not even Van Buren's party
loyalty would have prevented Clay's election.
Van Buren's friends saved the State; but in doing
so voted for annexation. In April, 1844,
Clay had written a letter against annexation. As
it appeared within a few days of Van Buren's
letter, and as the personal relations between the
two great party leaders were most friendly, some
have inferred an arrangement between them to
take the question out of politics. This would indeed
have been an extraordinary occurrence. One
might well wish to have overheard a negotiation
between two rivals for the presidency to exclude
a great question distasteful to both. After the
Democratic convention, Tyler's treaty of annexation
was rejected in the Senate by 35 to 16, six
Democrats from the North, among them Wright
of New York and Benton of Missouri, voting
against it. During the campaign Clay had
weakly abandoned even the mild emphasis of his
first opposition, and by flings at the abolitionists
had openly bid for the pro-slavery vote; thus perhaps
losing enough votes in New York to Birney
to defeat him. After the election the current for
annexation seemed too strong; and a resolution
passed both Houses authorizing the admission of
Texas as a State. The resolution provided for the
formation of four additional States out of Texas.
In any such additional State formed north of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Missouri compromise line, slavery was to be prohibited;
but in those south of it slavery was to be
permitted or prohibited as the inhabitants might
choose.</p>

<p>Slavery was now clearly before the political
conscience of the nation. Van Buren was the
conspicuous victim of the first encounter. The
Baltimore convention had in its platform complimented
"their illustrious fellow-citizen," "his inflexible
fidelity to the Constitution," his "ability,
integrity, and firmness," and had tendered to him,
"in honorable retirement," the assurance of the
deeply-seated "confidence, affection, and respect
of the American Democracy." This sentence to
"honorable retirement" Van Buren, who was
only in his sixty-second year and in the amplitude
of his natural powers, received with outward complacency.
On the eve of the election he pointed
out, probably referring to Cass, that the hostility
to him had not been in the interest of Polk, and
warmly said that, unless the Democratic creed
were a delusion, personal feelings ought to be
turned to nothing. Van Buren was, however,
profoundly affected by what he deemed the undeserved
Southern hostility to himself. For he hardly
yet appreciated that his defeat was politically legitimate,
and not the result of political treachery or
envy. Between him and the Southern politicians
had opened a true and deep division over the
greatest single question in American politics since
Jefferson's election.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>With Polk's accession and the Mexican war,
the schism in the Democratic ranks over the extension
of American slave territory became plainer.
Even during the canvass of 1844 a circular had
been issued by William Cullen Bryant, David
Dudley Field, John W. Edmonds, and other Van
Buren men, supporting Polk, but urging the choice
of congressmen opposed to annexation. Early in
the new administration the division of New York
Democrats into "Barnburners" and "Old Hunkers"
appeared. The former were the strong pro-Van
Buren, anti-Texas men, or "radical Democrats,"
who were likened to the farmer who burned
his barn to clear it of rats. The latter were the
"Northern men with Southern principles," the
supporters of annexation, and the respectable, dull
men of easy consciences, who were said to hanker
after the offices. The Barnburners were led by
men of really eminent ability and exalted character:
Silas Wright, then governor, Benjamin F.
Butler, John A. Dix, chosen in 1845 to the United
States Senate, Azariah C. Flagg, the famous comptroller,
and John Van Buren, the ex-President's
son, and a singularly picturesque figure in politics,
who was, in 1845, made attorney-general by the
legislature. He had been familiarly called "Prince
John" since his travels abroad during his father's
presidency. Daniel S. Dickinson and William L.
Marcy were the chief figures in the Hunker ranks.
Polk seemed inclined, at the beginning, to favor,
or at least to placate, the Barnburners. He offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
the Treasury to Wright, though he is said to have
known that Wright could not leave the governorship.
He offered Butler the War Department, but
the latter's devotion to his profession, for which he
had resigned the attorney-general's place in Van
Buren's cabinet, made him prefer the freedom of
the United States attorneyship at New York, and
Marcy was finally given the New York place
in the cabinet. Jackson's death in June, 1845,
deprived the Van Buren men of the tremendous
moral weight which his name carried, and which
might have daunted Polk. It perhaps also helped
to loosen the weight of party ties on the Van Buren
men. After this the schism rapidly grew. In
the fall election of 1845 the Barnburners pretty
thoroughly controlled the Democratic party of the
State in hostility to the Mexican war, which the
annexation of Texas had now brought. Samuel J.
Tilden of Columbia county, and a profound admirer
of Van Buren, became one of their younger
leaders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 531px;">
<img src="images/i437.jpg" width="531" height="800" alt="Silas Wright" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now arose the strife over the "Wilmot Proviso,"
in which was embodied the opposition to the extension
of slavery into new Territories. Upon this
proviso the modern Republican party was formed
eight years later; upon it, fourteen years later,
Abraham Lincoln was chosen president; and upon
it began the war for the Union, out of whose throes
came the vastly grander and unsought beneficence
of complete emancipation. David Wilmot was a
Democratic member of Congress from Pennsylvania;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
in New York he would have been a Barnburner.
In 1846 a bill was pending to appropriate
$3,000,000 for use by the President in a purchase
of territory from Mexico as part of a peace. Wilmot
proposed an amendment that slavery should
be excluded from any territory so acquired. All
the Democratic members, as well as the Whigs
from New York, and most strongly the Van Buren
or Wright men, supported the proviso. The Democratic
legislature approved it by the votes of the
Whigs with the Barnburners and the Soft Hunkers,
the latter being Hunkers less friendly to slavery.
It passed the House at Washington, but
was rejected by the Senate, not so quickly open to
popular sentiment. In the Democratic convention
of New York, in October, 1846, the "war for the
extension of slavery" was charged by the Barnburners
on the Hunkers. The former were victorious,
and Silas Wright was renominated for
governor, to be defeated, however, at the election.
Polk, Marcy, and Dickinson, angered at the Democratic
opposition in New York to the pro-slavery
Mexican policy, now threw all the weight of federal
patronage against the Barnburners, many of
whom believed the administration to have been
responsible for Wright's defeat. Van Buren and
his influence were completely separated from the
national administration. Just before the adjournment
of Congress in 1847, the appropriation to
secure territory from Mexico was again proposed.
Again the Wilmot Proviso was added in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
House; again it was rejected in the Senate, to the
defeat of the appropriation; and again Barnburners
and Whigs carried in the New York legislature
a resolution approving it, and directing the New
York senators to support it.</p>

<p>The tide was rising. It seemed that Mexican
law prohibited slavery in New Mexico and California,
and that upon their cession the principles
of international law would preserve their condition
of freedom. Benton, therefore, deemed the Wilmot
Proviso unnecessary; a "thing of nothing in
itself, and seized upon to conflagrate the States
and dissolve the Union." For the Supreme Court
had not then pronounced slavery a necessary accompaniment
of American supremacy. But the
legal protection of freedom was practically unsubstantial,
even if not technical; there could be no
doubt of the determination of the South to carry
slavery into these Territories, whatever might be
the obligations of either municipal or international
law; and their conquest, therefore, made imminent
a decision of the vital question whether slavery
should be still further extended.</p>

<p>At the Democratic convention at Syracuse, in
September, 1847, the Hunkers, after a fierce struggle
over contested seats, seized control of the body.
David Dudley Field, for the Barnburners, proposed
a resolution that, although the Democracy
of New York would faithfully adhere to the compromises
of the Constitution and maintain the reserved
rights of the States, they would still declare,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
since the crisis had come, "their uncompromising
hostility to the extension of slavery into territory
now free." This was defeated. The Barnburners
then seceded, and issued an address, in which
Lawrence Van Buren, the ex-President's brother,
joined. They protested that the anti-slavery resolution
had been defeated by a fraudulent organization
of the convention, and called a mass meeting at
Herkimer, on October 26, "to avow their principles
and consult as to future action." The Herkimer
convention was really an important preliminary to
the formation of the modern Republican party.
It was a gathering of the ex-President's friends.
Cambreleng, his old associate, presided; David
Wilmot addressed the meeting; and John Van
Buren, now very conspicuous in politics, reported
the resolutions. In these the fraud at Syracuse
was again denounced; a convention was called for
Washington's birthday in 1848, to choose Barnburner
delegates to contest the seats of those
chosen by the Hunkers in the national Democratic
convention. It was declared that the freemen of
New York would not submit to slavery in the conquered
provinces; and that, against the threat of
Democrats at the South that they would support
no candidate for the presidency who did not assent
to the extension of slavery, the Democrats of New
York would proclaim their determination to vote
for no candidate who did so assent.</p>

<p>It was clear that Van Buren sympathized with
all this. Relieved from the constraint of power,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
there strongly revived his old hostility to slavery;
he recalled his vote twenty-eight years before
against admitting Missouri otherwise than free.
He now perceived how profound had really been
the political division between him and the Southern
Democrats when, in 1844, he wrote his Texas
letter. Ignoring the legitimate character of the
politics of Polk's administration in denying official
recognition or reward to Barnburners,&mdash;legitimate
if, as Van Buren had himself pretty uniformly
maintained, patronage should go to friends rather
than enemies, and if, as was obvious, there had
arisen a true political division upon principles,&mdash;Van
Buren was now touched with anger at the proscription
of his friends. Excluded from the power
which ought to have belonged to the chief of Democrats
enjoying even in "honorable retirement"
the "confidence, affection, and respect" of his
party, independence rapidly grew less heinous in
his eyes. One can hardly doubt that there now
more freely welled up in his mind, to clarify its
vision, the sense of personal wrong which, since
Polk's nomination, had been so long held in magnanimous
and dignified restraint,&mdash;though of this
he was probably unconscious. Van Buren was not
insincere when, in October, 1847, he wrote from
Lindenwald to an enthusiastic Democratic editor
in Pennsylvania, who had hoisted his name to the
top of his columns for 1848. Whatever, he said,
had been his aspirations in the past, he now had
no desire to be President; every day confirmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
him in the political opinions to which he had adhered.
Conscious of always having done his duty
to the people to the best of his ability, he had "no
heart burnings to be allayed and no resentments to
be gratified by a restoration of power." Life at
Lindenwald was entirely adapted to his taste; and
he was (so he wrote, and so doubtless he had forced
himself to think) "sincerely and heartily desirous
to wear the honors and enjoyments of private life
uninterruptedly to the end." If tendered a unanimous
Democratic support with the assurance of
the election it would bring, he should not "hesitate
respectfully and gratefully, but decidedly to decline
it," adding, however, the proviso so precious
to public men, "consulting only my own feelings
and wishes." It was in the last degree improbable,
he said,&mdash;and so it was,&mdash;that any emergency
should arise in which this indulgence of his own
preferences would, in the opinion of his true and
faithful friends, conflict with his duty to the party
to which his whole life had been devoted, and to
which he owed any personal sacrifice. The Mexican
war had, he said, been so completely sanctioned
by the government that it must be carried through;
and, he ominously added, the propriety of thereafter
instituting inquiries into the necessity of its
occurrence, so as to fix the just responsibility to
public opinion of public servants, was then out of
season. Not a word of praise did he speak of
Polk's administration; in this he was for once
truly and grimly "non-committal."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>In the New York canvass of 1847, the Barnburners,
after their secession, "talked of indifferent
matters." The Whigs were therefore completely
successful. In the legislature the Barnburners, or
"Free-soilers" as they began to be called, outnumbered
the Hunkers. Dickinson proposed in
the Senate at Washington a resolution, the precursor
of Douglas's "squatter sovereignty,"&mdash;that
all questions concerning the domestic policy of the
Territories should be left to their legislatures to be
chosen by their people. Lewis Cass, now the coming
candidate of the South, asserted in December,
1847, the same proposition, pointing out that, if
Congress could abolish the relation of master and
servant in the Territories, it might in like manner
treat the relation of husband and wife. After
this "Nicholson letter" of his, Cass might well
have been asked whether he would have approved
the admission of a State where the last relation
was forbidden, and where concubinage existed as
a "domestic institution." Dickinson's proposal
meant that the first settlers of each Territory should
determine it to freedom or to slavery; it meant
that in admitting new States the nation ought to
be indifferent to their laws on slavery. If slavery
were a mere incident in the polity of the State, a
matter of taste or convenience, the proposition
would have been true enough. But euphemistic
talk about "domestic institutions" blinded none
but theorists or lovers of slavery to the truth that
slavery was a fearful and barbarous power, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
that it must become paramount in any new Southern
State, monstrous and corrupting in its tendencies
towards savagery, unyielding, wasteful, and
ruinous,&mdash;a power whose corruption and savagery,
whose waste and ruin, debauched and enfeebled
all communities closely allied to the States which
maintained it,&mdash;a power in whose rapid growth,
in whose affirmative and dictatorial arrogance, and
in the intellectual ability and even the moral excellences
of the aristocracy which administered it
at the South, there was an appalling menace. As
well might one propose the admission to political
intimacy and national unity of a State whose laws
encouraged leprosy or required the funeral oblations
of the suttee. If there were already slave
States in the confederacy, it was no less true that
the nation had profoundly suffered from their
slavery. Nor could all the phrases of constitutional
lawyers make the slave-block, the black laws,
and all the practices of this barbarism mere local
peculiarities, distasteful perhaps to the North but
not concerning it, peculiarities to be ranked with
laws of descent or judicial procedure. Cass and
Dickinson for their surrender to the South were
now called "dough-faces" and "slavocrats" by
the Democratic Free-soilers. They were the true
"Northern men with Southern principles."</p>

<p>The Barnburners met at Utica on February 16,
an earlier day than that first appointed, John Van
Buren again being the chief figure. The convention
praised John A. Dix for supporting the Wil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>mot
Proviso; and declared that Benton, a senator
from a slave State, but now a sturdy opponent of
extending the evil, and long the warm friend and
admirer of Van Buren, had "won a proud pre&euml;minence
among the statesmen of the day." Delegates
were chosen to the national convention to oppose
the Hunkers. In April, 1848, the Barnburner
members of the legislature issued an address, the
authors of which were long afterwards disclosed
by Samuel J. Tilden to be himself and Martin and
John Van Buren. At great length it demonstrated
the Free-soil principles of the Democratic fathers.</p>

<p>The national convention assembled in May,
1848. It offered to admit the Barnburner and
Hunker delegations together to cast the vote of
the State. The Barnburners rejected the compromise
as a simple nullification of the vote of the
State, and then withdrew. Lewis Cass was nominated
for president, the Wilmot Proviso being thus
emphatically condemned. For Cass had declared
in favor of letting the new Territories themselves
decide upon slavery. The Barnburners, returning
to a great meeting in the City Hall Park at New
York, cried, "The lash has resounded through the
halls of the Capitol!" and condemned the cowardice
of Northern senators who had voted with the
South. Among the letters read was one from
Franklin Pierce, who had in 1844 voted against
annexation, a letter which years afterwards was,
with a reference to his famous friend and biographer,
called the "Scarlet Letter." The delegates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
issued an address written by Tilden, fearlessly
calling Democrats to independent action. In June
a Barnburner convention met at Utica. Its president,
Samuel Young, who had refused at the convention
at Baltimore in 1844 to vote for Polk
when the rest of his delegation surrendered, said
that if the convention did its duty, a clap of political
thunder would in November "make the
propagandists of slavery shake like Belshazzar."
Butler, John Van Buren, and Preston King, afterwards
a Republican senator, were there. David
Dudley Field read an explicit declaration from the
ex-President against the action and the candidates
of the national convention. This letter, whose prolixity
is an extreme illustration of Van Buren's
literary fault, created a profound impression. He
declared his "unchangeable determination never
again to be a candidate for public office." The
requirement by the national convention that the
New York delegates should pledge themselves to
vote for any candidate who might be nominated
was, he said, an indignity of the rankest character.
The Virginia delegates had been permitted, without
incurring a threat of exclusion, to declare that
they would not support a certain nominee. The
convention had not allowed the Democrats of New
York fair representation, and its acts did not therefore
bind them.</p>

<p>The point of political regularity, when discussed
upon a technical basis, was, however, by no means
clear. The real question was whether the surren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>der
of the power of Congress over the Territories,
and the refusal to use that power to exclude slavery,
accorded with Democratic principles. On
this Van Buren was most explicit. Jefferson had
proposed freedom for the Northwest Territories;
and all the representatives from the slaveholding
States had voted for the ordinance. Not only
Washington and the elder and younger Adams
had signed bills imposing freedom as the condition
of admitting new Territories or States, but those
undoubted Democrats, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe,
and Jackson, had signed such bills; and so
had he himself in 1838 in the case of Iowa. This
power of Congress was part of "the compromises
of the Constitution," compromises which, "deeply
penetrated" as he had been "by the convictions
that slavery was the only subject that could endanger
our blessed Union," he had, he was aware,
gone further to sustain against Northern attacks
than many of his best friends approved. He would
go no further. As the national convention had
rejected this old doctrine of the Democracy, he
should not vote for its candidate, General Cass;
and if there were no other candidate but General
Taylor, he should not vote for president. If our
ancestors, when the opinion and conduct of the
world about slavery were very different, had rescued
from slavery the territory now making five
great States, should we, he asked, in these later
days, after the gigantic efforts of Great Britain
for freedom, and when nearly all mankind were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
convinced of its evils, doom to slavery a territory
from which as many more new States might be
made. He counseled moderation and forbearance,
but still a firm resistance to injustice.</p>

<p>This powerful declaration from the old chief of
the Democracy was decisive with the convention.
Van Buren was nominated for president, and
Henry Dodge, a Democratic senator of Wisconsin,
for vice-president. Dodge, however, declined,
proud though he would be, as he said, to have his
name under other circumstances associated with
Van Buren's. But his State had been represented
in the Baltimore convention; and as one of its
citizens he cordially concurred in the nomination
of Cass. A national convention was called to
meet at Buffalo on August 9, 1848.</p>

<p>Charles Francis Adams, the son of John Quincy
Adams, presided at the Buffalo convention; and
in it Joshua R. Giddings, the famous abolitionist,
and Salmon P. Chase were conspicuous. To the
unspeakable horror of every Hunker there participated
in the deliberations a negro, the Rev. Mr.
Ward. Butler reported the resolutions in words
whose inspiration is still fresh and ringing. They
were assembled, it was said, "to secure free soil
for a free people;" the Democratic and Whig
organizations had been dissolved, the one by stifling
the voice of a great constituency, the other
by abandoning its principles for mere availability.
Remembering the example of their fathers in the
first declaration of independence, they now, put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>ting
their trust in God, planted themselves on the
national platform of freedom in opposition to the
sectional platform of slavery; they proposed no
interference with slavery in any State, but its prohibition
in the Territories then free; for Congress,
they said, had "no more power to make a slave
than to make a king." There must be no more
compromises with slavery. They accepted the issue
forced upon them by the slave power; and to its
demand for more slave States and more slave Territories,
their calm and final answer was, "no more
slave States and no more slave territory." At the
close were the stirring and memorable words:
"We inscribe on our banner, Free Soil, Free
Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men; and under it
we will fight on and fight ever, until a triumphant
victory shall reward our exertions."</p>

<p>Joshua Leavitt of Massachusetts, one of the
"blackest" of abolitionists, reported to the convention
the name of Martin Van Buren for president.
After the convention was over, even Gerrit
Smith, the ultra-abolitionist candidate, declared
that, of all the candidates whom there was the
least reason to believe the convention would nominate,
Van Buren was his preference. The nomination
was enthusiastically made by acclamation,
after Van Buren had on an informal ballot received
159 votes to 129 cast for John P. Hale. A brief
letter from Van Buren was read, declaring that
his nomination at Utica had been against his
earnest wishes; that he had yielded because his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
obligation to the friends, who had now gone so
far, required him to abide by their decision that
his name was necessary to enable "the ever faithful
Democracy of New York to sustain themselves
in the extraordinary position into which they have
been driven by the injustice of others;" but that
the abandonment at Buffalo of his Utica nomination
would be most satisfactory to his feelings and
wishes. The exclusion of slavery from the Territories
was an object, he said, "sacred in the sight
of heaven, the accomplishment of which is due to
the memories of the great and just men long since,
we trust, made perfect in its courts." Charles
Francis Adams was nominated for vice-president;
and dazzled and incredulous eyes beheld on a presidential
ticket with Martin Van Buren the son of
one of his oldest and bitterest adversaries. That
adversary had died a few months before, the best
of his honors being his latest, those won in a querulous
but valiant old age, in a fiery fight for freedom.</p>

<p>In September, John A. Dix, then a Democratic
senator, accepted the Free-soil nomination for governor
of New York. The Democratic party was
aghast. The schismatics had suddenly gained
great dignity and importance. Martin Van Buren,
the venerable leader of the party, its most famous
and distinguished member, this courtly, cautious
statesman,&mdash;could it be he rushing from that
"honorable retirement," to whose safe retreat his
party had committed him with so deep an affec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>tion,
to consort with long-haired and wild-eyed
abolitionists! He was the arch "apostate," leading
fiends of disunion who would rather rule in
hell than serve in heaven. Where now was his
boasted loyalty to the party? Rage struggled
with loathing. All the ancient stories told of him
by Whig enemies were revived, and believed by
those who had long treated them with contempt.
It is clear, however, that Van Buren's attitude was
in no wise inconsistent with his record. His party
had never pronounced for the extension of slavery;
nor had he. The Buffalo convention was silent
upon abolition in the District of Columbia. There
was for the time in politics but one question, and
that was born of the annexation of Texas,&mdash;Shall
slavery go into free territory? As amid the clash
of arms the laws are stilled, so in the great fight
for human freedom, the independent treasury, the
tariff, and internal improvements could no longer
divide Americans.</p>

<p>The Whigs had in June nominated Taylor, one
of the two heroes of the Mexican war. It is a
curious fact that Taylor had been authoritatively
sounded by the Free-soil leaders as to an acceptance
of their nomination. Clay and Webster were
now discarded by their party for this bluff soldier,
a Louisiana slaveholder of unknown politics; and
with entire propriety and perfect caution the Whigs
made no platform. A declaration against the
extension of slavery was voted down. Webster
said at Marshfield, after indignation at Taylor's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
nomination had a little worn away, that for "the
leader of the Free-<i>spoil</i> party" to "become the
leader of the Free-soil party would be a joke to
shake his sides and mine." The anti-slavery Whigs
hesitated for a time; but Seward of New York
and Horace Greeley in the New York "Tribune"
finally led most of them to Taylor rather than, as
Seward said, engage in "guerrilla warfare" under
Van Buren. Whigs must not, he added, leave the
ranks because of the Whig affront to Clay and
Webster. "Is it not," he finely, though for the
occasion sophistically, said, "by popular injustice
that greatness is burnished?" This launching
of the modern Republican party was, strangely
enough, to include in New York few besides Democrats.
In November, 1847, the Liberty or Abolition
party nominated John P. Hale for president;
but upon Van Buren's nomination he was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Upon the popular vote in November, 1848, Van
Buren received 291,263 votes, while there were
1,220,544 for Cass and 1,360,099 for Taylor. Van
Buren had no electoral votes. In no State did he
receive as many votes as Taylor; but in New York,
Massachusetts, and Vermont he had more than
Cass. The vote of New York was an extraordinary
tribute to his personal power; he had 120,510
votes to 114,318 for Cass; and it was clear that
nearly all the former came from the Democratic
party. In Ohio he had 35,354 votes, most of which
were probably drawn from the Whig abolitionists.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
In Massachusetts he had 38,058 votes, in no small
part owing to the early splendor, the moral austerity
and elevation of Charles Sumner's eloquence.
"It is not," he said, "for the Van Buren of 1838
that we are to vote; but for the Van Buren of
to-day,&mdash;the veteran statesman, sagacious, determined,
experienced, who, at an age when most
men are rejoicing to put off their armor, girds
himself anew and enters the lists as champion of
Freedom." Taylor had 163 electoral votes and
Cass 127.</p>

<p>The political career of Van Buren was now
ended. It is mere speculation whether he had
thought his election a possible thing. That he
should think so was very unlikely. Few men had
a cooler judgment of political probabilities; few
knew better how powerful was party discipline in
the Democratic ranks, for no one had done more to
create it; few could have appreciated more truly
the Whig hatred of himself. Still the wakening
rush of moral sentiment was so strong, the bitterness
of Van Buren's Ohio and New York supporters
had been so great at his defeat in 1844,
that it seemed not utterly absurd that those two
States might vote for him. If they did, that dream
of every third party in America might come true,&mdash;the
failure of either of the two great parties to
obtain a majority in the electoral college, and the
consequent choice of president in the House, where
each of them might prefer the third party to its
greater rival. Ambition to re&euml;nter the White<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
House could indeed have had but the slightest influence
with him when he accepted the Free-soil
nomination. Nor was his acceptance an act of revenge,
as has very commonly been said. The motives
of a public man in such a case are subtle and
recondite even to himself. No distinguished political
leader with strong and publicly declared opinions,
however exalted his temper, can help uniting
in his mind the cause for which he has fought with
his own political fortunes. If he be attacked, he
is certain to honestly believe the attack made upon
the cause as well as upon himself. When his party
drives him from a leadership already occupied by
him, he may submit without a murmur; but he will
surely harbor the belief that his party is playing
false with its principles. In 1848 there was a great
and new cause for which Van Buren stood, and
upon which his party took the wrong side; but
doubtless his zeal burned somewhat hotter, the edge
of his temper was somewhat keener, for what he
thought the indignities to himself and his immediate
political friends. To say this is simply to
pronounce him human. His acceptance of the
nomination was given largely out of loyalty to
those friends whose advice was strong and urgent.
It was the mistake which any old leader of a political
party, who has enjoyed its honors, makes in
the seeming effort&mdash;and every such political candidacy
at least seems to be such an effort&mdash;to
gratify his personal ambition at its expense. Van
Buren and his friends should have made another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
take the nomination, to which his support, however
vigorous, should have gone sorrowfully and reluctantly;
and the form as well as the substance of
his relations to the canvass should have been without
personal interest.</p>

<p>Had Van Buren died just after the election of
1848 his reputation to-day would be far higher.
He had stood firmly, he had suffered politically,
for a clear, practical, and philosophical method and
limitation of government; he had adhered with
strict loyalty to the party committed to this method,
until there had arisen the cause of human freedom,
which far transcended any question still open upon
the method or limits of government. With this
cause newly risen, a cause surely not to leave the
political field except in victory, he was now closely
united. He might therefore have safely trusted to
the judgment of later days and of wiser and truer-sighted
men, growing in number and influence
every year. His offense could never be pardoned
by his former associates at the South and their
allies at the North. No confession of error, though
it were full of humiliation, no new and affectionate
return to party allegiance, could make them forget
what they sincerely deemed astounding treason and
disastrous sacrilege. Loyal remembrance of his
incomparable party services had irretrievably gone,
to be brought back by no reasoning and by no persuasion.
If he were to live, he should not have wavered
from his last position. Its righteousness was
to be plainer and plainer with the passing years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Buren did live, however, long after his honorable
battle and defeat; and lived to dim its honor
by the faltering of mistaken patriotism. In 1849,
John Van Buren, during the efforts to unite the
Democratic party in New York, declared it his wish
to make it "the great anti-slavery party of the
Union." Early in 1850 and when the compromise
was threatened at Washington, he wrote to
the Free-soil convention of Connecticut that there
had never been a time when the opponents of slavery
extension were more urgently called to act
with energy and decision or to hold their representatives
to a rigid responsibility, if they faltered or
betrayed their trust. With little doubt his father
approved these utterances. A year later, however,
the ex-President, with nearly all Northern men,
yielded to the soporific which Clay in his old age
administered to the American people. In their
support of the great compromise between slavery
and freedom, Webster and Clay forfeited much of
their fame, and justly. For though the cause of
humanity gained a vast political advantage in the
admission of California as a free State, the advantage,
it was plain, could not have been long delayed
had there been no compromise. But the rest of
the new territory was thrown into a struggle
among its settlers, although the power of Congress
over the Territories was not yet denied; and a
fugitive-slave law of singular atrocity was passed.
All the famous Northern Whigs were now true
"doughfaces." Fillmore, president through Tay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>lor's
death, one of the most dignified and timid of
their number, signed the compromise bills.</p>

<p>The compromise being passed, Van Buren with
almost the entire North submissively sought to
believe slavery at last expelled from politics. It
would have been a wise heroism, it would have
given Van Buren a clearer, a far higher place with
posterity, if after 1848 he had even done no more
than remain completely aloof from the timid politics
of the time, if he had at least refused acquiescence
in any compromise by which concessions
were made to slavery. But he was an old man.
He shared with his ancient and famous Whig
rivals that intense love and almost adoration of the
Union, upon which the arrogant leaders of the
South so long and so successfully played. The
compromise was accomplished. It would perhaps
be the last concession to the furious advance of
the cruel barbarism. The free settlers in the new
Territories would, he hoped, by their number and
hardihood, defeat the incoming slave-owners, and
even under "squatter sovereignty" save their homes
from slavery. If the Union should now stand
without further disturbance, all might still come
right without civil war. Economic laws, the inexorable
and beneficent progress of civilization, would
perhaps begin, slowly indeed but surely, to press
to its death this remnant of ancient savagery. But
if the Union were to be broken by a violation of
the compromise, a vast and irremediable catastrophe
and ruin would undo all the patriotic labors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
of sixty years, would dismiss to lasting unreality
the dreams of three generations of great men who
had loved their country. It seemed too appalling
a responsibility.</p>

<p>Upon all this reasoning there is much unfair
modern judgment. The small number of resolute
abolitionists, who cared little for the Union in
comparison with the one cause of human rights,
and whose moral fervor found in the compromises
of the Constitution, so dear and sacred to all
American statesmen, only a covenant with hell,
may for the moment be ignored. Among them
there was not a public man occupying politically
responsible or widely influential place. The vast
body of Northern sentiment was in two great
classes. The one was led by men like Seward,
and even Benton, who considered the South a great
bully. They believed that to a firm front against
the extension of slavery the South would, after
many fire-eating words, surrender in peace. The
other class included most of the influential men of
the day, some of them greater men, some lesser,
and some little men. Webster, Clay, Cass, Buchanan,
Marcy, Douglas, Fillmore, Dickinson, were
now joined by Van Buren and by many Free-soil
men of 1848 daunted at the seeming slowness
with which the divine mills were grinding.
They believed that the South, to assert the fancied
"rights" of their monstrous wrong, would accept
disunion and even more, that in this cause it would
fiercely accept all the terrors of a civil war and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
limitless devastation. The event proved the first
men utterly in the wrong; and it was fortunate
that their mistake was not visible until in 1861 the
battle was irreversibly joined. The second and
more numerous class were right. There had to be
yielding, unless such evils were to be let loose,
unless Webster's "ideas, so full of all that is horrid
and horrible," were to come true. The anxiety
not to offend the South was perhaps most strikingly
shown after the election of Lincoln. A distinguished
statesman of the modern Republican party
has recently pointed out<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that in February, 1861,
the Republican members of Congress, and among
them Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens, acquiesced
in the organization of the new Territories
of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, without
any prohibition of slavery, thus ignoring the very
principle and the only principle upon which their
great battle had been fought and their great victory
won.</p>

<p>Complete truth dwelt only with the small and
hated abolitionist minority. Without honored and
influential leaders in political life they alone saw
that war with all these horrors was better, or even
a successful secession was better, than further surrender
of human rights, a surrender whose corruption
and barbarism would cloud all the glories,
and destroy all the beneficence of the Union. No
historical judgment has been more unjust and
partial than the implied condemnation of Van
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>Buren for his acquiescence in Clay's compromise,
while only gentle words have chided the great
statesmen whose eloquence was more splendid and
inspiring but whose devotion to the Union was
never more supreme than Van Buren's,&mdash;statesmen
who had made no sacrifice like his in 1844,
who in their whitening years had taken no bold
step like his in 1848, and who had in 1850 actively
promoted the surrender to which Van Buren did
no more than submit after it was accomplished.</p>

<p>In 1852 the overwhelming agreement to the
compromise brought on a colorless presidential
campaign, fought in a sort of fool's paradise. Its
character was well represented by Franklin Pierce,
the second Democratic mediocrity raised to the
first place in the party and the land, and by
the absurd political figure of General Scott, fitly
enough the last candidate of the decayed Whig
party. Both parties heartily approved the compromise,
but it mattered little which of the two
candidates were chosen. The votes cast for John
P. Hale, the Free-soil candidate, were as much
more significant and honorable as they were fewer
than those cast for Pierce or Scott. Van Buren,
in a note to a meeting in New York, declared that
time and circumstances had issued edicts against
his attendance, but that he earnestly wished for
Pierce's election. He attempted no argument in
this, perhaps the shortest political letter he ever
wrote. But John Van Buren, in a speech at Albany,
gave some reasons which prevent much con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>demnation
of his father's perfunctory acquiescence
in the action of his party. The movement of 1848,
he said, had been intended to prevent the extension
of slavery. Since then, California had come in, a
Free State, and not, as the South had desired, a
slave State; and "the abolition of the slave market
in the District of Columbia was another great point
gained." The poverty of reasons was shown in
the eager insistence that every member of Congress
from New Hampshire had voted against slavery
extension, and that the Democratic party now took
its candidate from that State "without any pledges
whatever."</p>

<p>After this election Van Buren spent two years
in Europe. President Pierce tendered him the
position of the American arbitrator upon the British-American
claims commission established under
the treaty of February 8, 1853, but he declined.
During his absence the South secured the Kansas-Nebraska
bill, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,
and the practical opening to slavery of
the new Territories north of the line of 36&deg; 30'.
If the settlers of Kansas, which lay wholly on the
free side of that compromise line, desired slavery,
they were to have it. But even this was not
sufficient. The hardy settlers of this frontier,
separated though they were by the slave State of
Missouri from free soil and free influences, would,
it now seemed, pretty certainly favor freedom.
The ermine of the Supreme Court had, therefore, to
be used to sanctify with the Dred Scott decision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
the last demand of slavery, inconsistent though it
was with the claims of the South from the time
when it secured the Missouri Compromise until
Calhoun grimly advanced his monstrous propositions.
Slavery was to be decreed a constitutional
right in all Territories, whose exercise in them Congress
was without power to prohibit, and which
could not be prevented even by the majority of
their settlers until they were admitted as States.</p>

<p>Van Buren came back to America when there
was still secret within the judicial breast the momentous
decision that the American flag carried
human slavery with it to conquered territory as a
necessary incident of its stars and stripes, and that
Congress could not, if it would, save the land to
freedom. Van Buren voted for Buchanan; a vote
essentially inconsistent with his Free-soil position,
a vote deeply to be regretted. He still thought
that free settlers would defeat the intention of the
Kansas-Nebraska act, and bring in, as they afterwards
did, a free though bleeding Kansas. There
was something crude and menacing in this new
Republican party, and in its enormous and growing
enthusiasm. It was hard to believe that its candidate
had been seriously selected for chief magistrate
of the United States. Fremont probably
seemed to Van Buren a picturesque sentimentalist
leading the way to civil war, which, if it were to
come, ought, so it seemed to this former senator
and minister and president, to be led in by serious
and disciplined statesmen. The new party was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
repulsive to him as a body chiefly of Whigs; old
and bitter adversaries whom he distrusted, with
hosts of camp-followers smelling the coming spoils.
All this a young man might endure, when he
saw the clear fact that the Republican convention,
ignoring for the time all former differences, had
pronounced not a word inconsistent with the Democratic
platform of 1840, and had made only the
one declaration essential to American freedom and
right, that slavery should not go into the Territories.
Van Buren was not, however, a young man,
or one of the few old men in whom a fiery sense of
morality, and an eager and buoyant resolution, are
unchilled by thinner and slower blood, and indomitably
overcome the conservative influences of age.
A bold outcry from him, even now, would have
placed him for posterity in one of the few niches set
apart to the very greatest Americans. But since
1848 Van Buren had come to seventy-four years.</p>

<p>Invited to the Tammany Hall celebration of Independence
Day, he wrote, on June 28, 1856, a
letter in behalf of Buchanan. There was no diminution
in explicit clearness; but hope was nearly
gone; the peril of the Union obscured every other
danger; the South was so threatening that patriotism
seemed to him to require at the least a surrender
to all that had passed; and for the future our
best reliance would be upon a fair vote in Kansas
between freedom and slavery. He could not come
to its meeting, he told Tammany Hall, because of
his age. He had left one invitation unanswered;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
and if he were so to leave another, he might be
suspected of a desire to conceal his sentiments.
But this letter should be his last, as it was his
first, appearance in the canvass. He was glad of
the Democratic reunion; for although not always
perfectly right, in no other party had there been
"such exclusive regard and devotion to the maintenance
of human rights and the happiness and
welfare of the masses of the people." There was
a touch of age in his fond recitals of the long services
of that party since, in Jefferson's days, it had
its origin with "the root-and-branch friends of the
Republican system;" of its support of the war of
1812; of its destruction of the national bank; of
its establishment of an independent treasury. But
slavery, he admitted, was now the living issue.
Upon that he had no regrets for his course. He
had always preferred the method of dealing with
that institution practiced by the founders of the
government. He lamented the recent departure
from that method; no one was more sincerely opposed
than himself to the repeal of the Missouri
Compromise. He had heard of it, and condemned
it in a foreign land; he had there foreseen the
disastrous reopening of the slavery agitation. But
the measure was now accomplished; there was no
more left than to decide what was the best now to
do. The Kansas-Nebraska act had, he said, gradually
become less obnoxious to him; though this
impression, he admitted, might result from the
unanimous acquiescence in it of the party in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
he had been reared. Its operation, he trusted,
would be beneficial; and he had now come to believe
that the feelings and opinions of the free
States would be more respected under its provisions
than by specific congressional interference.
He did not doubt the power of Congress to enable
the people of a Territory to exclude slavery. Buchanan's
pledge to use the presidential power to
restore harmony among the sister States could be
redeemed in but one way; and that was, to secure
to the actual settlers of the Territory a "full, free,
and practical enjoyment" of the rights of suffrage
on the slavery question conferred by the act. He
praised Buchanan, if not exuberantly, still sufficiently.
He must, Van Buren thought, be solicitous
for his reputation in the near "evening of his
life." He believed that Buchanan would redeem
his pledge, and should therefore cheerfully support
him. If Buchanan were elected, there were "good
grounds for hope" that the Union might be saved.
Such was this saddening and despondent letter.
It was a defense of a vote which it was rather sorry
work that he should have needed to make. But the
tramp of armies and the conflagration of American
institutions were heard and seen in the sky with
terrifying vividness. The letter secured, however,
no forgiveness from the angry South. The "Richmond
Whig" said: "If there is a man within the
limits of the Republic who is cordially abhorred and
detested by intelligent and patriotic men of all parties
at the South, that man is Martin Van Buren."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the best Americans shared Van Buren's
distrust of Fremont and of those who supported
Fremont; they shared his love of peace
and his fear of that bloodshed, North and South,
which seemed the dismal El Dorado to which the
"pathfinder's" feet were surely tending. So the
majority of the Northern voters thought; for those
north of Mason and Dixon's line who divided
themselves between Buchanan and Fillmore, the
candidate of the "Silver Gray" Whigs, considerably
outnumbered the voters for Fremont.</p>

<p>In 1860 Van Buren voted for the union electoral
ticket which represented in New York the
combined opposition to Lincoln. Every motive
which had influenced him in 1856 had now increased
even more than his years. The Republican
party was not only now come bringing, it
seemed, the torch in full flame to light an awful
conflagration; but in its second national convention
there became obvious upon the tariff question
the preponderance of the Whig elements, which
made up the larger though not the more earnest or
efficient body of its supporters.</p>

<p>After Van Buren's return from Europe in 1855,
he lived in dignified and gracious repose. This
complete and final escape from the rush about him
had often seemed in his busy strenuous years full
of delight. But doubtless now in the peaceful
pleasures of Lindenwald and in the occasional
glimpses of the more crowded social life of New
York which was glad to honor him, there were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
regrets and slowly dying impatience, the sense of
isolation, which must at the best touch with some
sadness the later and well-earned and even the
best-crowned years. At this time he began writing
memoirs of his life and times, which were brought
down to the years 1833-1834; but they were
never revised by him and have not been published.
Out of this work grew a sketch of the early growth
of American parties, which was edited by his sons
and printed in 1867. Its pages do not exhibit the
firm and logical order which was so characteristic of
Van Buren's political compositions. It was rather
the reminiscence of the political philosophy which
had completely governed him. With some repetitions,
but in an easy and interesting way, he recalled
the far-reaching political differences between
Jefferson and Hamilton. In these chapters of his
old age are plain the profound and varied influences
which had been exercised over him by the
great founder of his party, and his unquenchable
animosity towards "the money power" from the
days of the first secretary of the treasury to its
victory of "buffoonery" in 1840. In one chapter,
with words rather courtly but still not to be mistaken,
he condemns Buchanan for a violation of
the principles of Jefferson and Jackson in accepting
the Dred Scott decision as a rule of political
action; and this the more because its main conclusion
was unnecessary to adjudge Dred Scott's
rights in that suit, and because its announcement
was part of a political scheme. Chief Justice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
Taney and Buchanan, Van Buren pointed out,
though raised to power by the Democratic party,
had joined it late in life, "with opinions formed
and matured in an antagonist school." Both had
come from the Federalist ranks, whose political
heresy Van Buren believed to be hopelessly incurable.</p>

<p>At the opening of the civil war Van Buren's animosity
to Buchanan's behavior became more and
more marked. He strongly sympathized with the
uprising of the North; and sustained the early
measures of Lincoln's administration. But he
was not to see the dreadful but lasting and benign
solution of the problem of American slavery. His
life ended when the fortunes of the nation were at
their darkest; when McClellan's seven days' battle
from the Chickahominy to the James was just over,
and the North was waiting in terror lest his troops
might not return in time to save the capital. For
several months he suffered from an asthmatic attack,
which finally became a malignant catarrh, causing
him much anguish. In the latter days of his sickness
his mind wandered; but when sensible and
collected he still showed a keen interest in public
affairs, expressed his confidence in President Lincoln
and General McClellan, and declared his faith
that the rebellion would end without lasting damage
to the Union.</p>

<p>On July 24, 1862, he died, nearly eighty years
old, in the quiet summer air at Lindenwald, the
noise of battle far away from his green lawns and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
clumps of trees. In the ancient Dutch church at
Kinderhook the simple funeral was performed;
and a great rustic gathering paid the last and best
honor of honest and respectful grief to their old
friend and neighbor. For his fame had brought
its chief honor to this village of his birth, the village
to which in happy ending of his earthly career
he returned, and where through years of well-ordered
thrift, of a gentle and friendly hospitality,
and of interesting and not embittered reminiscence,
he had been permitted</p>

<span class="ft80">VAN BUREN'S CHARACTER AND PLACE IN HISTORY</span></h2>


<p>In the engraved portrait of Van Buren in old age,
prefixed to his "History of Parties," are plainly
to be seen some of his traits,&mdash;the alert outlooking
upon men, the bright, easy good-humor, the firm,
self-reliant judgment. Inman's painting, now in
the City Hall of New York,<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> gives the face in the
prime of life,&mdash;the same shrewd, kindly expression,
but more positively touched with that half
cynical doubt of men which almost inevitably belongs
to those in great places. The deep wrinkles
of the old and retired ex-president were hardly yet
incipient in the smooth, prosperous, almost complacent
countenance of the governor. In the earlier
picture the locks flared outwards from the face, as
they did later; as yet, however, they were dark
and a bit curling. His form was always slender
and erect, but hardly reached the middle height, so
that to his political enemies it was endless delight
to call him "Little Van."</p>

<p>In the older picture one sees a scrupulous daintiness
about the ruffled shirt and immaculate neck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>erchief;
for Van Buren was fond of the elegance
of life. The Whigs used to declare him an aristocrat,
given to un-American, to positively British
splendor. Very certainly he never affected contempt
for the gracious and stately refinement suited
to his long held place of public honor, that contempt
which a silly underrating of American good
sense has occasionally commended to our statesmen.
At Lindenwald, among books and guests
and rural cares, he led what in the best and truest
sense was the life of a country gentleman, not set
like an urban exotic among the farmers, but fond
of his neighbors as they were fond of him, and
unaffectedly sharing without loss of distinction or
elegance their thrifty and homely cares. When
he retired to this home he was able, without undignified
or humiliating shifts, to live in ease and
even affluence. For in 1841 his fortune of perhaps
$200,000 was a generous one. His last days
were not, like those of Jefferson and Monroe and
Jackson, embittered by money anxieties, the penalty
of the careless profusion the temptation to
which, felt even by men wise in the affairs of others,
is often greater than the certain danger and unwisdom
of its indulgence. But no suggestion was
breathed against his pecuniary integrity, public or
private. Nor was there heard of him any story of
wrong or oppression or ungenerous dealing.</p>

<p>Van Buren's extraordinary command of himself
was apparent in his manners. They are finely
described from intimate acquaintance by William<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
Allen Butler, the son of Van Buren's long-time
friend, in his charming and appreciative sketch
printed just after Van Buren's death. They had,
Mr. Butler said, a neatness and polish which served
every turn of domestic, social, and public intercourse.
"As you saw him once, you saw him always&mdash;always
punctilious, always polite, always
cheerful, always self-possessed. It seemed to anyone
who studied this phase of his character as if,
in some early moment of destiny, his whole nature
had been bathed in a cool, clear, and unruffled
depth, from which it drew this life-long serenity
and self-control." An accomplished English traveler,
"the author of 'Cyril Thornton,'" who saw
him while secretary of state, and before he had
been abroad, said that he had more of "the manner
of the world" than any other of the distinguished
men at Washington; that in conversation he was
"full of anecdote and vivacity." Chevalier, one
of our French critics, in his letters from America
described him as setting up "for the American
Talleyrand." John Quincy Adams, as has been
said, sourly mistook all this, and even the especial
courtesy Van Buren paid him after his political
downfall, as mere proof of insincerity; and he
more than once compared Van Buren to Aaron
Burr, a comparison of which many Democrats
were fond after 1848. In his better-natured moments,
however, Adams saw in his adversary a
resemblance to the conciliatory and philosophic
Madison. For his "extreme caution in avoiding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
and averting personal collisions," he called him
another Sosie of Moli&egrave;re's "Amphitryon," "ami
de tout le monde."</p>

<p>Van Buren's skill in dealing with men was indeed
extraordinary. It doubtless came from this
temper of amity, and from an inborn genius for
society; but it had been wonderfully sharpened in
the unrivaled school of New York's early politics.
When he was minister at London, he wrote that he
was making it his business to be cordial with prominent
men on both sides; a branch of duty, he
said, in which he was not at home, because he had
all his life been "wholly on one side." But he
was jocosely unjust to himself. He was, for the
politics of his day, abundantly fair to his adversaries.
Sometimes indeed he saw too much of
what might be said on the other side. Had he
seen less, he would sometimes have been briefer,
less indulgent in formal caution. Nor did he fail
to avoid the unnecessary misery caused to many
public men, the obstacles needlessly raised in their
way, by personal disputes, or by letting into negotiations
matters of controversy irrelevant to the
thing to be done. Patience in listening, a steady
and singularly acute observance of the real end he
sought, and a quick, keen reading of men, saved
him this wearing unhappiness so widespread in
public life. Once he thus criticised his friend
Cambreleng: "There is more in small matters
than he is always aware of, although he is a really
sensible and useful man." In this maxim of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
lesser things Van Buren was carefully practiced.
During the Jackson-Adams campaign, the younger
Hamilton was about sending to some important
person an account of the general. Van Buren,
knowing of this, wrote to Hamilton, and, after
signing his letter, added: "P. S.&mdash;Does the old
gentleman have prayers in his own house? If so,
mention it modestly."</p>

<p>His self-command was not stilted or unduly precise
or correct. He was very human. A candidate
for governor of New York would to-day hardly
write to another public man, however friendly to
him, as Van Buren in August and September, 1828,
wrote to Hamilton. "Bet on Kentucky, Indiana,
and Illinois," he said, "jointly if you can, or any
two of them; don't forget to bet all you can."
But this was the fashion of the day.<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> His life was
entirely free from the charges of dissipation or of
irregular habits, then so commonly, and often truly,
made against great men. This very correctness
was part of the offense he gave his rivals and their
followers. It would hardly be accurate to describe
him, even in younger years, as jovial with his
friends; but he was perfectly companionable. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>a social and cheerful temper, he not only liked the
decorous gaiety of receptions and public entertainment,
but was delighted and delightful in closer
and easier conversation and in the chat of familiar
friends. His reminiscences of men are said to have
been full of the charm which flows from a strong
natural sense of humor, and a correct and vivid
memory of human action and character.</p>

<p>There are many apocryphal stories of Van Buren's
craft or cunning or selfishness in politics. It
is a curious appreciation with which reputable historians
have received such stories from irresponsible
or anonymous sources; for they deserve as little
credence as those told of Lincoln's frivolity or
indecency. To them all may not only be pleaded
the absence of any proof deserving respect, but
they are refuted by positive proof, such as from
earliest times has been deemed the best which private
character can in its own behalf offer to history.
In politics Van Buren enjoyed as much
strong and constant friendship as he encountered
strong and constant hatred. Nothing points more
surely to the essential soundness of life and the
generosity of a public man than the near and long-continued
friendship of other able, upright, and
honorably ambitious men. It was an extraordinary
measure in which Van Buren enjoyed friendship
of this quality. With all the light upon his
character, Jackson was too shrewd to suffer long
from imposition. His intimacy with Van Buren
for twenty years and more was really affectionate;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
his admiration for the younger statesman was profound.
The explanation is both unnecessary and
unworthy, which ascribes to hatred of Clay all
Jackson's ardor in the canvass of 1840 or his almost
pathetic anxiety for Van Buren's nomination
in 1844. Their peculiar and continuous association
for six years at Washington had so powerfully
established Van Buren in his love and respect,
that neither distant separation nor disease nor the
nearer intrigues and devices of rivals could abate
them. Those who were especially known as Van
Buren men, those who not only stood with him in
the party but who went with him out of it, were
men of great talents and of the highest character.
Butler's career closely accompanied Van Buren's.
Both were born at Kinderhook; they were together
in Hudson, in Albany, in Washington; they were
together as Bucktails, as Jacksonian Democrats, as
Free-soil men; they were close to one another from
Butler's boyhood until, more than a half-century
later, they were parted by death. To this strong-headed
and sound-hearted statesman, we are told
by William Allen Butler, in a fine and wellnigh
sufficient eulogy, that Van Buren was the object
of an affection true and steadfast, faithful through
good report and evil report, loyal to its own high
sense of duty and affection, tender and generous.
Benton, liberal and sane a slaveholder though he
was, did not approve the Wilmot Proviso, or join
the Free-soil revolt. But in retirement and old
age, reviewing his "Thirty Years," during twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
of which he and Van Buren had, spite of many
differences, remained on closely intimate terms, he
showed a deep liking for the man. Silas Wright,
Azariah C. Flagg, and John A. Dix, all strong and
famous characters in the public life of New York,
were among the others of those steadily faithful in
loyal and unwavering regard for this political and
personal chief. Nor were they deceived. Jackson
and Butler, Wright and Flagg and Dix, sturdy,
upright, skillful, experienced men of affairs, were
not held in true and lifelong friendship and admiration
by the insinuating manners, the clever management,
the selfish and timid aims, which make
the Machiavellian caricature of Van Buren so
often drawn. No American in public life has
shown firmer and longer devotion to his friends.
His reputation for statesmanship must doubtless
rest upon the indisputable facts of his career. But
for his integrity of life, for his sincerity, for his
fidelity to those obligations of political, party, and
personal friendship, within which lies so much of
the usefulness as well as of the singular charm of
public life, his relations with these men make a
proof not to be questioned, and surely not to be
weakened by the malicious or anonymous stories
of political warfare.</p>

<p>For the absurdly sinister touch which his political
enemies gave to his character, it is difficult
now to find any just reason. It may be that the
cool and imperturbable appearance of good-nature,
with which he received the savage and malevolent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
attacks so continually made upon him, to many
seemed so impossible to be real as to be sheer hypocrisy;<a name="FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and from the fancy of such hypocrisy it
was easy for the imagination to infer all the arts
and characteristics of deceit. Doubtless the caution
of Van Buren's political papers irritated impatient
and angry opponents. They found them
full of elaborate and subtle reservations, as they
fancied, against future political contingencies; a
charge, it ought to be remembered, which is continually
made against the ripest, bravest, and
greatest character in English politics of to-day or
of the century.<a name="FNanchor_2_23" id="FNanchor_2_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Van Buren's reasoning was perfectly
clear, and his style highly finished. But he
had not the sort of genius which in a few phrases
states and lights up a political problem. The complexity
of human affairs, the danger of short and
sweeping assertions, pressed upon him as he wrote;
and the amplitude of his arguments, sometimes
tending to prolixity, seemed timid and lawyer-like
to those who disliked his conclusions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Buren was not, however, an unpopular man,
except as toward the last his politics were unpopular
as politics out of sympathy with those of either
of the great parties, and except also at the South,
where he was soon suspected and afterwards hated
as an anti-slavery man. He was on the whole a
strong candidate at the polls. In his own State
and at the Northeast his strength with the people
grew more and more until his defeat by the slaveholders
in 1844. Perhaps the most striking proof
of this strength was the canvass of 1848, when in
New York he was able to take fully half of his
party with him into irregular opposition, a feat
with hardly a precedent in our political history.
And there was complete reciprocity. Van Buren
was profoundly democratic in his convictions.
He thoroughly, honestly, and without demagogy
believed in the common people and in their competence
to deal wisely with political difficulties.
Even when his faith was tried by what he deemed
the mistakes of popular elections, he still trusted
to what in a famous phrase of his he called "the
sober second thought of the people."<a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>However widely the student of history may differ
from the politics of Van Buren's associates, the
politics of Benton, Wright, Butler, and Dix, and
in a later rank of his New York disciples, of Sam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>uel
J. Tilden and Sanford E. Church, it is impossible
not to see that their political purpose was at
the least as long and steady as their friendship for
Van Buren. Love for the Union, a belief in a
simple, economical, and even unheroic government,
a jealousy of taking money from the people, and
a scrupulous restriction upon the use of public
moneys for any but public purposes, a strict limitation
of federal powers, a dislike of slavery and
an opposition to its extension,&mdash;these made up
one of the great and fruitful political creeds of
America, a creed which had ardent and hopeful
apostles a half century ago, and which, save in the
articles which touched slavery and are now happily
obsolete, will doubtless find apostles no less ardent
and hopeful a half century hence. Each of its
assertions has been found in other creeds; but the
entire creed with all its articles made the peculiar
and powerful faith only of the Van Buren men.
As history gradually sets reputations aright, the
leader of these men must justly wear the laurel of
a statesman who, apart from his personal and party
relations and ambitions, has stood clearly for a
powerful and largely triumphant cause.</p>

<p>No vague, no thoughtless rush of popular sentiment
touched or shook this faith of Van Buren.
Had there been indeed a readier emphasis about
him, a heartier and quicker sympathy with the
temper of the day, he would perhaps have aroused
a popular enthusiasm, he might perhaps have been
the hero which in fact he never was. But his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
intellectual perceptions did not permit the subtle
self-deceit, the enthusiastic surrender to current
sentiment, to which the striking figures that delight
the masses of men are so apt to yield. Van
Buren was steadfast from the beginning to the
end, save when the war threats of slavery alarmed
his old age and the sober second thought of a
really patient and resolute people seemed a long
time coming. Two years before his death Jefferson
wrote to Van Buren an elaborate sketch of
his relations with Hamilton and of our first party
division. Two years before his own death Van
Buren was finishing a history of the same political
division written upon the theory and in the tone
running through Jefferson's writings. It was composed
by Van Buren in the very same temper in
which he had respectfully read the weighty epistle
from the great apostle of Democracy. Between
the ending life at Monticello and that at Lindenwald,
the political faith of the older man had been
steadily followed by the younger.</p>

<p>The rise of the "spoils" system, and the late
coming, but steadily increasing perception of its
corruptions and dangers, have seriously and justly
dimmed Van Buren's fame. But history should
be not less indulgent to him than to other great
Americans. The practical politics which he first
knew had been saturated with the abuse. He did
no more than adopt accustomed means of political
warfare. Neither he nor other men of his time
perceived the kind of evil which political proscrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>tion
of men in unpolitical places must yield.
They saw the undoubted rightfulness of shattering
the ancient idea that in offices there was a property
right. They saw but too clearly the apparent help
which the powerful love of holding office brings to
any political cause, and which has been used by
every great minister of state the world over. Van
Buren had, however, no love of patronage in itself.
The use of a party as a mere agency to distribute
offices would have seemed to him contemptible.
In neither of the great executive places which he
held, as governor, secretary of state, or president,
did he put into an extreme practice the proscriptive
rules which were far more rigorously adopted
about him. To his personal temper not less than
to his conceptions of public duty the inevitable
meanness and wrong of the system were distasteful.</p>

<p>Chief among the elements of Van Buren's public
character ought to be ranked his moral courage
and the explicitness of his political utterances,&mdash;the
two qualities which, curiously enough, were
most angrily denied him by his enemies. His well-known
Shocco Springs letter of 1832 on the tariff
was indeed lacking in these qualities; but he was
then not chiefly interested. There was only a
secondary responsibility upon him. But it is not
too much to say that no American in responsible
and public station, since the days when Washington
returned from his walk among the miserable
huts at Valley Forge to write to the Continental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
Congress, or to face the petty imbecilities of the
jealous colonists, has shown so complete a political
courage as that with which Van Buren faced the
crisis of 1837, or in which he wrote his famous
Texas letter. Nor did any American, stirred with
ambition, conscious of great powers, as was this
captain of politicians, and bringing all his political
fortunes, as he must do, to the risks of universal
suffrage, ever meet living issues dangerously dividing
men ready to vote for him if he would but
remain quiet, with clearer or more decided answers
than did Van Buren in his Sherrod Williams letter
of 1836 and in most of his chief public utterances
from that year until 1844. The courtesies of his
manner, his failure in trenchant brevity, and even
the almost complete absence of invective or extravagance
from his papers or speeches, have obscured
these capital virtues of his character. He saw too
many dangers; and he sometimes made it too clear
that he saw them. But upon legitimate issues he
was among the least timid and the most explicit of
great Americans. No president of ours has in
office been more courageous or more direct.</p>

<p>It is perhaps an interesting, it is at least a harmless
speculation, to look for Van Buren's place of
honor in the varied succession of men who have
reached the first office, though not always the first
place, in American public life. Every student will
be powerfully, even when unconsciously, influenced
in this judgment by the measure of strength or
beneficence he accords to different political tend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>encies.
With this warning the present writer will,
however, venture upon an opinion.</p>

<p>Van Buren very clearly does not belong among
the mediocrities or accidents of the White House,&mdash;among
Monroe, Harrison, Tyler, Polk, Taylor,
Fillmore, and Pierce, not to meddle with the years
since the civil war whose party disputes are still
part of contemporary politics. Van Buren reached
the presidency by political abilities and public services
of the first order, as the most distinguished
active member of his party, and with a universal
popular recognition for years before his promotion
that he was among the three or four Americans
from whom a president would be naturally chosen.
Buchanan's experience in public life was perhaps
as great as Van Buren's, and his political skill and
distinction made his accession to the presidency by
no means unworthy. But he never led, he never
stood for a cause; he never led men; he was never
chief in his party; and in his great office he sank
with timidity before the slaveholding aggressors,
as they strove with vengeance to suppress freedom
in Kansas, and before the menaces and open plunderings
of disunion. Van Buren showed no such
timidity in a place of equal difficulty.</p>

<p>Jackson stands in a rank by himself. He had
a stronger and more vivid personality than Van
Buren. But useful as he was to the creation of a
powerful sentiment for union and of a hostility to
the schemes of a paternal government, it is clear
that in those qualities of steady wisdom, foresight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
patience, which of right belong to the chief magistracy
of a republic, he was far inferior to his less
picturesque and less forceful successor. The first
Adams, a man of very superior parts, competent
and singularly patriotic, was deep in too many
personal collisions within and without his party,
and his presidency incurred too complete and lasting,
and it must be added, too just a popular condemnation,
to permit it high rank, though very
certainly he belonged among neither the mediocrities
nor the accidents of the White House.</p>

<p>If to the highest rank of American presidents
be assigned Washington, and if after him in it
come Jefferson and perhaps Lincoln (though more
than a quarter of a century must go to make
the enduring measure of his fame), the second
rank would seem to include Madison, the younger
Adams, and Van Buren. Between the first and
the last of these, the second of them, as has been
said, saw much resemblance. But if Madison had
a mellower mind, more obedient to the exigencies
of the time and of a wider scholarship, Van Buren
had a firmer and more direct courage, a steadier
loyalty to his political creed, and far greater resolution
and efficiency in the performance of executive
duties. If one were to imitate Plutarch in
behalf of John Quincy Adams and Van Buren, he
would need largely to compare their rival political
creeds. But leaving these, it will not be unjust to
say that in virile and indomitable continuance of
moral purpose after official power had let go its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
trammels, and when the harassments and feebleness
of age were inexorable, and though the heavens
were to fall, the younger Adams was the greater;
that in executive success they were closely together
in a high rank; but that in skill and power of
political leadership, in breadth of political purpose,
in freedom from political vagaries, in personal
generosity and political loyalty, Van Buren was
easily the greater man.</p>

<p>Van Buren did not have the massive and forcible
eloquence of Webster, or the more captivating
though fleeting speech of Clay, or the delightful
warmth of the latter's leadership, or the strength
and glory which their very persons and careers
gave to American nationality. But in the persistent
and fruitful adherence to a political creed
fitted to the time and to the genius of the American
people, in that noble art which gathers and binds
to one another and to a creed the elements of a
political party, the art which disciplines and guides
the party, when formed, to clear and definite purposes,
without wavering and without weakness or
demagogy, Van Buren was a greater master than
either of those men, in many things more interesting
as they were. In this exalted art of the politician,
this consummate art of the statesman, Van
Buren was close to the greatest of American party
leaders, close to Jefferson and to Hamilton.</p>

<p>In his very last years the stir and rumbling of
war left Van Buren in quiet recollection and anxious
loyalty at Lindenwald. As his growing ill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>ness
now and then spared him moments of ease,
his mind must sometimes have turned back to the
steps of his career, senator of his State, senator of
the United States, governor, first cabinet minister,
foreign envoy, vice-president, and president. There
must again have sounded in his ears the hardly
remembered jargon of Lewisites and Burrites,
Clintonians and Livingstonians, Republicans and
Federalists, Bucktails and Jacksonians and National
Republicans, Democrats and Whigs, Loco-focos
and Conservatives, Barnburners and Hunkers.
There must rapidly though dimly have shifted
before him the long series of his struggles,&mdash;struggles
over the second war with England, over internal
improvements, the Bank, nullification, the divorce
of bank and state, the resistance to slavery
extension. Through them all there had run, and
this at least his memory clearly recalled, the
one strong faith of his politics and statesmanship.
In all his labors of office, in all his multifarious
strifes, he never faltered in upholding the Union.
But not less firmly would this true disciple of Jefferson
restrain the activities of the federal government.
Whatever wisdom, whatever integrity of
purpose might belong to ministers and legislators
at Washington,&mdash;though the strength of the United
States might be theirs, and though they were panoplied
in the august prestige rightly ascribed by
American patriotism to that sovereign title of our
nation,&mdash;still Van Buren was resolute that they
should not do for the people what the States or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
people themselves could do as well. To his eyes
there was clear and undimmed from the beginning
to the close of his career, the idea of government
as an instrument of useful public service, rather
than an object of superstitious veneration, the idea
but two years after his death clothed with memorable
words by a master in brief speech, the democratic
idea of a "government of the people, by the
people, for the people."</p>

of the organization of Van Buren's party at Chicago in 1896. It
is safe to say that these traditions, even if fallen sadly out of
sight, still make a deep and powerful force, which must in due
time assert itself.</p></div>

not only in the first Home Rule campaign in 1886, but
during the Salisbury administration from 1886 to 1892, and in the
campaigns of 1892 and 1895, the coalition was ended and a new
and single party formed, of which the Duke of Devonshire and
Mr. Chamberlain were leaders as really as Lord Salisbury or Mr.
Balfour. The accession of the former to the Unionist ministry
of 1895 was in no sense a reward for bringing over some of the
enemy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_9" id="Footnote_1_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> This was written in 1887. The Albany Regency, after a life
of sixty years, ended with the death of Daniel Manning, in Mr.
Cleveland's first presidency, and with it ended the characteristic
influence of its organ. The Democratic management at Albany
has since proceeded upon very different lines and has engaged
the ability of very different men.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_10" id="Footnote_1_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> A month or two after his arrival Van Buren wrote Hamilton
that his place was decidedly the most agreeable he had ever held,
but added: "Money&mdash;money is the thing." His house was
splendid and in a delightful situation; but it cost him &pound;500.
His carriage cost him &pound;310, and his servants with their board
$2,600.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_11" id="Footnote_1_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> In estimating the popular vote in 1828, Delaware and South
Carolina are excluded, their electors having been chosen by the
legislature. In Georgia in that year there was no opposition to
Jackson. In 1832 no popular vote is included for South Carolina
or for Alabama. In Mississippi and Missouri there was no opposition
to Jackson. In 1829, upon Van Buren's recommendation
when governor, the system in New York of choosing electors by
districts, which had been in force in the election of 1838, was
abolished; and there was adopted the present system of choosing
all the electors by the popular vote of the whole State.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_12" id="Footnote_1_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The Treasurer's statement for August, 1837, gave eighty-four
deposit banks. But of these, nine had less than $5000 each on
deposit, six from $5000 to $10,000, and eight from $10,000 to
$20,000. Fourteen had from $50,000 to $100,000 each. Only
twenty-nine had more than $100,000 each. It is not unfair to
speak of the deposits as being substantially in fifty banks.
</p><p>
The enormous land sales at the Southwest had placed a most
disproportionate amount of money in banks in that part of the
country. John Quincy Adams seemed, but with little reason,
to consider this an intentional discrimination against the North.
It is quite probable that, if the deposits had been in one national
bank, the peculiarly excessive strain at that point would have
been modified. But this was no great factor in the crisis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_13" id="Footnote_1_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> I cannot refrain from noticing here the curious fact that Dr.
Von Holst, after a contemptuous picture of Van Buren as a mere
verbose, coarse-grained politician given to scheming and duplicity,
was not surprised at his meeting in so lofty a spirit this really great
trial. For surely here, if anywhere, the essential fibre of the man
would be discovered. I must also express my regret that this
writer, to whom Americans owe very much, should have been
content (although in this he has but joined some other historians of
American politics) to accept mere campaign or partisan rumors
which when directed against other men, have gone unnoticed, but
against Van Buren have become the basis for emphatic disparagement
and contumely. Even Mackenzie, the publisher of the purloined
letters, writing his pamphlet with the most obvious and
reckless venom, is quoted by this learned historian as respectable
authority. Van Buren had refused during nearly a year to pardon
Mackenzie from prison for his unlawful use of American territory
to prepare armed raids on Canada. Sir Francis B. Head's opinion
was doubtless somewhat colored; but he was not entirely without
justification in applying to Mackenzie the words: "He lies out of
every pore in his skin. Whether he be sleeping or waking, on foot
or on horseback, together with his neighbors or writing for a newspaper,
a multitudinous swarm of lies, visible, palpable, and tangible,
are buzzing and settling about him like flies around a horse
in August." (Narrative of Sir F. B. Head, London, 1839.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_14" id="Footnote_1_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The reference was to commercial paper and not to bank-notes.
But both had been active characteristics of American speculation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_15" id="Footnote_1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The depositories now authorized for the proceeds of the internal
revenue secured the government by a deposit of the bonds
of the latter, which the depositories must of course purchase and
own. (<i>U. S. Rev. Stats.</i> &sect; 5153.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_16" id="Footnote_1_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> I cannot refrain in this revised edition to note that England,
although not always a ready scholar, has in later years learned a
farseeing wisdom which in colonial administration makes her the
teacher of the world. The modern policy of deference to local
sentiment and of finding her own advantage in the independent
prosperity of the colony, has bound continents, islands, races, religions,
to the English empire, and brought from them wealth to
England, as the old rule of force never did.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_17" id="Footnote_1_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> It should be remembered that several great expenses of the
White House were then and are now met by special and additional
appropriations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_18" id="Footnote_1_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> I must again complain of the curious though unintended unfairness
of Professor Von Holst (<i>Const. Hist. of the U. S.</i> 1828-1846,
Chicago, 1879, p. 663). He treats this letter with great
contempt. He assumes indeed that Van Buren's declaration
for annexation would have given him the nomination; and admits
that Van Buren declared himself "decidedly opposed to annexation."
After this sufficient proof of courage, for Van Buren
could at least have simply promised to adopt the vote of Congress
on the main question, it was not very sensible to declare "disgusting"
Van Buren's efforts "to creep through the thorny hedge
which shut him off from the party nomination." Professor Von
Holst's "disgust" seems particularly directed against the passage
here annotated where, after his strong argument against
annexation, he declared that he would not be influenced by sectional
feeling, and would obey the wishes of a Congress chosen
with reference to the question. Few, I think, will consider this
promise with reference to such a question, either cowardly or
"disgusting," made, as it was, by a candidate for the presidency,
of a democratic republic, after clearly and firmly declaring his
own views in advance of the congressional elections.</p></div>

written for the campaign of 1836.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_21" id="Footnote_1_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The mania for election betting among public men was very
curious. In the letters and memoranda printed by Mackenzie, the
bets of John Van Buren and Jesse Hoyt are given in detail. They
ranged from $5000 to $50; from "three cases of champagne" or
"two bales of cotton," to "boots, $7," or "a ham, $3." They
were made with the younger Alexander Hamilton, James Watson
Webb, Moses H. Grinnell, John A. King, George F. Talman,
Dudley Selden, and other notable men of the time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_22" id="Footnote_1_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> One of the latest and most important historians of the time,
after saying that "nothing ruffled" Van Buren, is contented with
a different explanation from mine. Professor Sumner says that
"he was thick-skinned, elastic, and tough; he did not win confidence
from anybody." But within another sentence or two the
historian adds, as if effect did not always need adequate cause,
that "as president he showed the honorable desire to have a
statesmanlike and high-toned administration." (Sumner's <i>Jackson</i>,
p. 451.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_23" id="Footnote_2_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Here again I spoke of Gladstone, to whom, as this revised
edition is going to press, the civilized world is bringing, in his
death, a noble and fitting tribute.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_24" id="Footnote_1_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> This expression was not original with Van Buren, as has been
supposed. It was used by Fisher Ames in 1788; and Bartlett's
<i>Quotations</i> also gives a still earlier use of part of it by Matthew
Henry in 1710.</p></div>
